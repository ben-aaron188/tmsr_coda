Meeting with Dan, Jeff, Paul, Bennett, Rasoul and Caspar

novel developments in the history of 60 years

break up dataset in historical decades or sth

Constructs that are considered different but that are used in similar ways

* Code specific terms

Frame this in terms of the historical development of the field

Resource management dilemma

Public goods dilemma

Prisoner's dilemma

Nomological net


1. This is just as valuable as a narrative review, and overcomes some of its limitations
2. The output format is very close to a nomological net, so it provides an excellent starting point for (formal) theory development: this gives us the building blocks
3. Serendipitous findings might further sell this paper; new developments, undertheorized phenomena, etc.

Effect of time is interesting

Notes of meeting with Bennett and Rasoul

1. Do we need/want duplicated words? They all are somewhat different in their embeddings, of course, but seem to cluster together (so little added value)

1. Run on entire dataset
2. Merge vectors of same words, then run on this reduced dataset
3. Compare cluster assignments between full and reduced dataset


2. If we go for unique words, we drastically reduce the size (from 130k 
--> 8k). These results are done. Needs some refinement in the
hyperparameters (esp. the "esp" parameter).

3. You went for the hierarchical DBSCAN. I haven't done that one yet. 
Remind me: what is the rationale of the hierarchical approach for the theoretical insights?

n-grams

1. Improve preprocessing, because right now the words are still too noisy for bigram analysis
2. Use text rank to identify n-grams (2 or 3-grams)
3. Enhance the dataset at sentence level with n-grams that occur in more than 5% or so of papers
4. To get embedding of n-grams, average the embeddings of the constituent words
