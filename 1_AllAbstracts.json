 study experimentally how enforcement influences public goods provision  when subjects face two free-rider options that roughly parallel the  nonparticipation and noncompliance options available for countries in  relation to multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). Our results  add to the MEA literature in two ways. First, they suggest that  compliance enforcement will fail to enhance compliance in the absence of  participation enforcement. Second, they indicate that compliance  enforcement will boost compliance significantly in the presence of  participation enforcement. Our results also add to the experimental  literature on public goods provision, again in two ways. First, they  reveal that previous experimental findings of enforcement boosting  cooperation are valid only in settings with forced (or enforced)  participation. Second, they show that subjects\u2019 willingness to allocate  costly punishment points is significantly stronger when the enforcement  system permits punishment of both types of free riding than when it  permits punishment of only one type.","1":"Human  cooperation is an evolutionary puzzle. Unlike other creatures, people  frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in  large groups, with people they will never meet again, and when  reputation gains are small or absent. These patterns of cooperation  cannot be explained by the nepotistic motives associated with the  evolutionary theory of kin selection and the selfish motives associated  with signalling theory or the theory of reciprocal altruism. Here we  show experimentally that the altruistic punishment of defectors is a key  motive for the explanation of cooperation. Altruistic punishment means  that individuals punish, although the punishment is costly for them and  yields no material gain. We show that cooperation flourishes if  altruistic punishment is possible, and breaks down if it is ruled out.  The evidence indicates that negative emotions towards defectors are the  proximate mechanism behind altruistic punishment. These results suggest  that future study of the evolution of human cooperation should include a  strong focus on explaining altruistic punishment.","2":"nan","3":" We document the widespread existence of antisocial  punishment, that is, the sanctioning of people who behave prosocially.  Our evidence comes from public goods experiments that we conducted in 16  comparable participant pools around the world. However, there is a huge  cross-societal variation. Some participant pools punished the high  contributors as much as they punished the low contributors, whereas in  others people only punished low contributors. In some participant pools,  antisocial punishment was strong enough to remove the  cooperation-enhancing effect of punishment. We also show that weak norms  of civic cooperation and the weakness of the rule of law in a country  are significant predictors of antisocial punishment. Our results show  that punishment opportunities are socially beneficial only if  complemented by strong social norms of cooperation. ","4":" Understanding the fundamental patterns and  determinants of human cooperation and the maintenance of social order in  human societies is a challenge across disciplines. The existing  empirical evidence for the higher levels of cooperation when altruistic  punishment is present versus when it is absent systematically ignores  the institutional competition inherent in human societies. Whether  punishment would be deliberately adopted and would similarly enhance  cooperation when directly competing with nonpunishment institutions is  highly controversial in light of recent findings on the detrimental  effects of punishment. We show experimentally that a sanctioning  institution is the undisputed winner in a competition with a  sanction-free institution. Despite initial aversion, the entire  population migrates successively to the sanctioning institution and  strongly cooperates, whereas the sanction-free society becomes fully  depopulated. The findings demonstrate the competitive advantage of  sanctioning institutions and exemplify the emergence and manifestation  of social order driven by institutional selection. ","5":"This  paper provides strong evidence challenging the self-interest assumption  that dominates the behavioral sciences and much evolutionary thinking.  The evidence indicates that many people have a tendency to voluntarily  cooperate, if treated fairly, and to punish noncooperators. We call this  behavioral propensity \u201cstrong reciprocity\u201d and show empirically that it  can lead to almost universal cooperation in circumstances in which  purely self-interested behavior would cause a complete breakdown of  cooperation. In addition, we show that people are willing to punish  those who behaved unfairly towards a third person or who defected in a  Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game with a third person. This suggests that strong  reciprocity is a powerful device for the enforcement of social norms  involving, for example, food sharing or collective action. Strong  reciprocity cannot be rationalized as an adaptive trait by the leading  evolutionary theories of human cooperation (in other words, kin  selection, reciprocal altruism, indirect reciprocity, and costly  signaling theory). However, multilevel selection theories of cultural  evolution are consistent with strong reciprocity.","6":"<jats:p>Contemporary political theory often assumes that individuals cannot make credible commitments where substantial temptations exist to break them unless such commitments are enforced by an <jats:italic>external<\/jats:italic> agent. One such situation may occur in relation to <jats:italic>common pool resources<\/jats:italic>, which are natural or man-made resources whose yield is subtractable and whose exclusion is nontrivial (but not necessarily impossible). Examples include fisheries, forests, grazing ranges, irrigation systems, and groundwater basins. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that appropriators in common pool resources develop credible commitments in many cases without relying on external authorities. We present findings from a series of experiments exploring (1) covenants alone (both one-shot and repeated communication opportunities); (2) swords alone (repeated opportunities to sanction each other); and (3) covenants combined with an internal sword (one-shot communication followed by repeated opportunities to sanction each other).<\/jats:p>","7":" Abstract      Sanctioning institutions are of utmost importance for overcoming free-riding tendencies and enforcing outcomes that maximize group welfare in social dilemma situations. We investigate, theoretically and experimentally, the endogenous formation of institutions in public goods provision. Our theoretical analysis shows that players may form sanctioning institutions in equilibrium, including those governing only a subset of players. The experiment confirms that institutions are formed and that it positively affects cooperation and group welfare. However, the data also shows that success is not guaranteed. Players are unwilling to implement equilibrium institutions in which some players have the opportunity to free ride. Our results emphasize the role of fairness in the institution formation process.

We conduct a series of experiments in which subjects form  groups using three different entry and exit rules. The experimental  results are analyzed in terms of group size, the level of public good  provision, social efficiency, congestion and group stability. We find  that entry restriction improves the average earnings for some  individuals compared to free entry\/exit or restricted exit. For a given  group size, individuals under the restricted entry rule contribute more  for the provision of the collective good. Also, for a given average  contribution level of group members, subjects under the restricted entry  rule suffer less from the congestion problem and are better able to  form groups of sizes closer to the optimal.","10":"This  paper uses laboratory experiments to evaluate the performance of a  deposit-refund mechanism used to enforce compliance with voluntary  public-good commitments made in the absence of strong regulatory  institutions. With this mechanism agents decide whether to join an  agreement and pay a deposit prior to making their contribution  decisions. If an agreement receives sufficient membership to form,  members then make their contribution decisions and compliant members are  refunded their deposits. If an agreement does not form, then deposits  are immediately refunded and a standard voluntary contribution game is  played. We find that the deposit-refund mechanism achieves nearly full  efficiency when agreements require full participation, but is far less  effective, and in some cases disruptive, when agreements require only  partial participation. As the mechanism does not require the existence  of strong sanctioning institutions, it is particularly suited for  enforcing compliance with international environmental agreements.","11":"nan","12":"A  voluntary blood donation system can be seen as a public good. People  can take advantage without contributing and have a free ride. We  empirically analyse the extent of free riding and its determinants.  Interviews of the general public in Spain (n\u00a0=\u00a01,211)  were used to ask whether respondents were (or have been) regular blood  donors and, if not, the reason. Free riders are defined as those who are  medically capable to donate blood but do not. In addition, we  distinguish four different types of free riding depending on the reason  given for not donating. Binomial and multinomial logit models estimate  the effect of individual characteristics on the propensity to free ride  and the likelihood of the free rider types. Amongst those who are able  to donate, there is a 67\u00a0% probability of being a free rider. The  most likely free rider is female, single, with low\/no education and  abstained from voting in a recent national election. Gender, age,  religious practice, political participation and regional income explain  the type of free rider.","13":"Laboratory  experiments on free riding have produced mixed results. Free riding is  seldom observed with single-shot games; however, it is often  approximated in finitely repeated games. There are two prevailing  hypothesis for why this is so: strategies and learning. This paper  discusses these hypotheses and presents an experiment that examines  both.","14":"Eleven  closely related experiments testing the free rider hypothesis under  different conditions, and sampling various subpopulations, are reported.  Results question the empirical validity and generality of a strong  version of the hypothesis. Some reasons for its failure are discussed.","15":"  Abstract  This paper reports on a series of laboratory experiments  designed to evaluate a mechanism for the voluntary provision of public  good. The public good is provided if the total contributions meet or  exceed a threshold and all contributions are returned if the public good  is not provided. The members of the group all know the threshold, the  incomes, and the valuations assigned the public good by all other  members. The results support the prediction that this mechanism will  yield Pareto efficient outcomes and suggest that economic agents adopt  strategies which form equilibria satisfying certain refinements to the  Nash equilibrium.   ","16":"For  an experiment on the problem of collective action, randomly selected  high school students were randomly assigned to groups which were  confronted with an investment opportunity. Each subject could invest  resources provided by the experimenter in either a private good, which  returned a fixed amount of money to the individual per token invested,  or a public good. The public good returned money to the group and,  beyond a given provision point, returned much more money per token  invested than did the private good. All money from the public good was  divided according to a present formula. Thus, subjects could \"free ride\"  on the public good, if other group members invested in it, by taking  their share of it and keeping their own resources for themselves. Groups  were randomly designated as either large or small, and unequal or equal  in the distribution of interest and of resources within the group.  Results indicate that the effects of free riding were much weaker than  would be predicted from most economic theory. As predicted from the  theory, however, small groups containing an individual whose interest in  the public good exceeded the cost of its provision (i.e., small,  unequal-interest groups) invested more in the public good than any other  type of group. No additional significant effects of group size or  interest or resource distribution were found.","17":"The  most important single observation from this research is the similarity  between our wide range of results and the multitude of seemingly  divergent conclusions about free riding from previous experimental  results. Even when defined in the restrictive manner of this paper, free  riding is neither absolutely all pervasive nor always nonexistent. This  \u2018intermediate\u2019 result is not the same as a general theory which  states that the predictable result of public goods provision processes  is always weak free riding. The extremes of strong free riding and  near-Lindahl optimal behavior can and do occur.These experiments  further demonstrate that this diversity of outcome need not be  attributed to inexplicable randomness. At least for the case of the  voluntary contribution mechanism, there are identifiable factors which  make free riding more or less likely to occur. Two such factors have  been identified here: (i) the replication environment and (ii) per  capita marginal return. This latter parameter can be related to although  it is not equivalent to group size.This research is not intended  to \u2018model\u2019 a precise quantitative prediction about free riding. Having  identified, in a general manner, these effects, the groundwork is set  for many interesting questions in future research:  1) Although the qualitative results more often  suggest that \u2018free riding\u2019 behavior increases with experience, there are  no statistically supported conclusions. A design focusing on the factor  of experience could reveal whether this effect is sustained under more  extensive replication.   2) The influence of marginal per capita return is  striking. Why is there a difference when zero contribution is a single  period dominant strategy for either level (.3 or .75)? How extensive is  the interaction of replication and marginal per capita return? We are  currently conducting a new set of experiments focusing upon these  issues.   3) Given the power of the marginal per capita  return, what happens in situations in which this parameter varies, as in  a quadratic return function?   4) Why did some individuals contribute positive  amounts even in the 10th period when the learning and multiperiod gaming  aspects were presumably of minimal effect? We conjecture that this  represents a core of people for whom utility functions are not  completely selfish or who otherwise wish to believe in \u2018good guy\u2019  fashion. However, it is possible that some individuals were still  learning their single period dominant strategy or did not correctly  notice the presence of a truly single period decision environment. In  any case, it appears that marginal per capita return again plays a role.   5) With the group production technology held  constant, increasing group size (with a concomitant decrease in marginal  per capita return) has the expected effect of increasing \u2018free riding\u2019  type behavior. Standardizing for marginal per capita return, the effect  of group size becomes ambiguous, and shows evidence of reversing. This  aspect of group size effects is another area for future research. Our  ongoing research will also look at this question.   6) What can be said about economies which lack condition D*?  If individuals have no dominant strategy, the very concept of \u2018free  riding\u2019 becomes poorly defined. Definitions and predictions must  explicitly state what assumptions about expectations and what solution  concepts are being employed.   In summary, we find that there is no successful general theory which  states that all individuals always free ride a lot, always free ride a  little, or never free ride. Under the appropriate circumstances, we find  people who will do any or all of the above. This research gives some  guidelines as to why and when free riding can be expected. Further work  in both theory and experiments may be able to tell even more.","18":"Conventional  economic wisdom maintains that expansion of group size exacerbates  group members' free riding tendencies. Nevertheless, experimental  studies attempting to account for the effects of group size on free  riding have failed to support a pure \u201cnumbers effect.\u201d This study  corroborates these experimental findings by examining contributions of  church members from congregations of three prominent U.S. Protestant  denominations. As a whole, these results show that, for congregations  ranging from 7 members to 3,294 members, per member contributions do not  decline with increased membership. The free-rider problem does not  appear to be exacerbated by increases in group size.","19":"  Abstract   We introduce two variants of the  one\u2010shot joy\u2010of\u2010destruction minigame (mini\u2010JOD).

We test whether this feature  reduces the moral costs of nastiness, and find that destruction rates  rise significantly, despite the absence of strategic reasons.

In this paper, we review  the experimental evidence on how people solve cooperation problems.  Existing studies show without doubt that direct and indirect reciprocity  are important determinants of successful cooperation. We also discuss  the insights from a large literature on the role of peer punishment in  sustaining cooperation. The experiments demonstrate that many people are  \u2018strong reciprocators\u2019 who are willing to cooperate and punish others  even if there are no gains from future cooperation or any other  reputational gains. We document this in new one-shot experiments, which  we conducted in four cities in Russia and Switzerland. Our  cross-cultural approach allows us furthermore to investigate how the  cultural background influences strong reciprocity. Our results show that  culture has a strong influence on positive and in especially strong  negative reciprocity. In particular, we find large cross-cultural  differences in \u2018antisocial punishment\u2019 of pro-social cooperators.  Further cross-cultural research and experiments involving different  socio-demographic groups document that the antisocial punishment is much  more widespread than previously assumed. Understanding antisocial  punishment is an important task for future research because antisocial  punishment is a strong inhibitor of cooperation.","21":"The  prospect of receiving a monetary sanction for free riding has been  shown to increase contributions to public goods. We ask whether the  impulse to punish is unresponsive to the cost to the punisher, or  whether, like other preferences, it interacts with prices to generate a  conventional demand curve. In a series of experiments, we randomly vary  the cost of reducing the earnings of other group members following  voluntary contribution decisions. In our design, new groups are formed  after each interaction and no subject faces any other more than once, so  there is no strategic reason to punish. We nonetheless find significant  levels of punishment, and we learn that both price and the extent to  which the recipient's contribution is below the group mean are  significant determinants of the quantity of punishment demanded.  Moreover, punishment is mainly directed at free riders even when it  costs nothing to the punisher.","22":"We  introduce the joy-of-destruction game. Two players each receive an  endowment and simultaneously decide on how much of the other player's  endowment to destroy. In a treatment without fear of retaliation, money  is destroyed in almost 40% of all decisions.","23":"This  article explains deviations from formal expectations regarding choice  behavior in settings where economic rationality (i.e., own payoff  maximization) dictates either cooperating (full contribution) or free  riding (no contribution) in the provision of public goods via the  voluntary contribution mechanism. The authors find that the difference  between full contribution and the observed level of contribution is  greater than or equal to the corresponding difference when free riding  is the best strategy. This surprising result is interpreted as the  \u201cspiteful\u201d behavior of subjects whose first priority is not the total  amount of payoff they receive but the ranking among them.","24":"Contributions  from five voluntary-contribution public-goods laboratory sessions do  not converge to the conventional equilibrium at which the individually  rational action for each subject coincides with the collectively  rational action.

Our subjects have a diverse socio-economic  background that we relate to the answers of a survey on trust attitudes  and to contribution behavior in a one-shot public goods game. We find  that the socio-economic background affects trust attitudes, but we find  no separate influence of socio-economic variables on cooperative  behavior in a one-shot public goods experiment. However, cooperation is  significantly positively correlated to trust toward strangers and  beliefs about the fairness and helpfulness of others.","26":"Recent  experiments have shown that voluntary punishment of free riders can  increase contributions, mitigating the free-rider problem. But  frequently punishers punish high contributors, creating \u201cperverse\u201d  incentives which can undermine the benefits of voluntary punishment.In  our experiment, allowing punishment of punishing behaviors reduces  punishment of high contributors, but gives rise to efficiency-reducing  second-order \u201cperverse\u201d punishment. On balance, efficiency and  contributions are slightly but not significantly enhanced.","27":"Are  decisions in economics experiments distorted because the money subjects  risk comes from the experimenter rather than their own pockets? There  is some evidence that people receiving small, one time \u201cwindfall gains\u201d  have a higher marginal propensity to consume them, and when doing so,  exhibit greater risk-seeking behaviour. This has been found in  individual decision making experiments when anticipated wealth effects  have been controlled, and labelled the \u201chouse money effect.\u201d In public  good experiments, house money effects could be driving the high levels  of voluntary contributions commonly observed. This possibility is tested  by comparing VCM contribution rates when subjects supply their own  endowments with those when endowments are provided, while holding  constant the distribution of promised earnings. No evidence of house  money effects is found, suggesting that use of \u201cfree\u201d initial money  endowments does not distort subsequent contributions in VCM  environments.","28":"Social  norms are an important element in explaining how humans achieve very  high levels of cooperative activity. It is widely observed that, when  norms can be enforced by peer punishment, groups are able to resolve  social dilemmas in prosocial, cooperative ways. Here we show that  punishment can also encourage participation in destructive behaviours  that are harmful to group welfare, and that this phenomenon is mediated  by a social norm. In a variation of a public goods game, in which the  return to investment is negative for both group and individual, we find  that the opportunity to punish led to higher levels of contribution,  thereby harming collective payoffs. A second experiment confirmed that,  independently of whether punishment is available, a majority of subjects  regard the efficient behaviour of non-contribution as socially  inappropriate. The results show that simply providing a punishment  opportunity does not guarantee that punishment will be used for socially  beneficial ends, because the social norms that influence punishment  behaviour may themselves be destructive.","29":"We  examine the characteristics and relative strength of third-party  sanctions in a series of experiments. We hypothesize that egalitarian  distribution norms and cooperation norms apply in our experiments, and  that third parties, whose economic payoff is unaffected by the norm  violation, may be willing to enforce these norms although the  enforcement is costly for them. Almost two-thirds of the third parties  indeed punished the violation of the distribution norm and their  punishment increased the more the norm was violated. Likewise, up to  roughly 60% of the third parties punished violations of the cooperation  norm. Thus, our results show that the notion of strong reciprocity  extends to the sanctioning behavior of \u201cunaffected\u201d third parties. In  addition, these experiments suggest that third-party punishment games  are powerful tools for studying the characteristics and the content of  social norms. Further experiments indicate that second parties, whose  economic payoff is reduced by the norm violation, punish the violation  much more strongly than do third parties.","30":"Experiments  have shown that punishment enhances socially beneficial cooperation but  that the costs of punishment outweigh the gains from cooperation. This  challenges evolutionary models of altruistic cooperation and punishment,  which predict that punishment will be beneficial. We compared 10- and  50-period cooperation experiments. With the longer time horizon,  punishment is unambiguously beneficial.","31":"Explaining  the evolution and maintenance of cooperation among unrelated  individuals is one of the fundamental problems in biology and the social  sciences. Recent findings suggest that altruistic punishment is an  important mechanism maintaining cooperation among humans. We  experimentally explore the boundaries of altruistic punishment to  maintain cooperation by varying both the cost and the impact of  punishment, using an exceptionally extensive subject pool. Our results  show that cooperation is only maintained if conditions for altruistic  punishment are relatively favourable: low cost for the punisher and  high impact on the punished. Our results indicate that punishment is  strongly governed by its cost-to-impact ratio and that its effect on  cooperation can be pinned down to one single variable: the threshold  level of free-riding that goes unpunished. Additionally, actual pay-offs  are the lowest when altruistic punishment maintains cooperation,  because the pay-off destroyed through punishment exceeds the gains from  increased cooperation. Our results are consistent with the  interpretation that punishment decisions come from an amalgam of  emotional response and cognitive cost\u2013impact analysis and suggest that  altruistic punishment alone can hardly maintain cooperation under  multi-level natural selection. Uncovering the workings of altruistic  punishment as has been done here is important because it helps  predicting under which conditions altruistic punishment is expected to  maintain cooperation.","32":"We  report an experiment on two treatments of an ultimatum minigame. In one  treatment, responders\u2019 reactions are hidden to proposers. We observe  high rejection rates reflecting responders\u2019 intrinsic resistance to  unfairness. In the second treatment, proposers are informed, allowing  for dynamic effects over eight rounds of play. The higher rejection  rates can be attributed to responders\u2019 provision of a public good:  Punishment creates a group reputation for being \u201ctough\u201d and effectively  \u201ceducate\u201d proposers. Since rejection rates with informed proposers drop  to the level of the treatment with non-informed proposers, the  hypothesis of responder\u2019s enjoyment of overt punishment is not  supported.","33":"  Abstract  We compare a partners condition , where the same small group of subjects plays a repeated public good game, to a strangers condition ,  where subjects play this game in changing group formations.

We also employ  Andreoni's partners\/strangers design to measure reputation effects. The  only difference observed is that the strangers treatment produces  slightly more random variation in behavior. Our results explain some  anomalies about contribution rates, and support past findings that  reputation-building plays a minor role in such experiments.","36":"Cooperation  in social dilemma situations is often explained in terms of egoistic  incentives. These include: (i) explicit side payments in the form of  rewards for cooperation and negative sanctions for defection, (ii)  expectations of reciprocal altruism from others involved, and (iii)  internalized positive utilities (e.g., an enhanced self-esteem) for  \u2018doing the thing\u2019 or negative ones (e.g., a bad conscience) for  defecting. Such egoistic explanations assumed that cooperation can occur  only when the dilemma situation is, in effect, transformed into one not  involving a dilemma.Subjects in  experiments summarized here made a single anonymous binary choice  between cooperation and defection involving substantial amounts of  money. High rates of cooperation were, nevertheless, obtained when the  benefits of doing so accrued to members of a group that discussed the  problem. Cooperation was not enhanced by discussion when its benefits  accrued to members of another group, from which subjects had been  separated on a random basis only a few minutes earlier; thus, we reject  the internalized norm hypothesis. Finally, while discussion involved a  great deal of promising to cooperate, such promising was unrelated to  actual choice \u2013 both at the individual and group level \u2013 except when it  was unanimous. Both the hypothesis that promising yields expectations of  a satisfactory payoff for cooperation, and that promising binds  subjects to cooperate due to the social rewards and punishments for  keeping or reneging on promises in similar situations outside our  laboratory, imply a positive correlation between promising and  cooperation short of universal promising, rather than the obtained  step-level function at that point. Our conclusion is that a consensus of  promising to cooperate indicates group identity, which must either  interact with cooperative commitments to make them effective, or may in  itself be a sufficient condition to elicit cooperation. Such cooperation  is far from synonymous with morality.","37":"In  public good situations, expectations concerning other persons\u2019 moves  are important and subtle cues can affect these expectations. In  Experiment 1, participants in a public good game who moved  simultaneously made high contributions and expected their opponents to  make high contributions. However, participants who moved  pseudo-sequentially (one after the other, but without knowledge of the  other\u2019s decision) expected their opponents to make medium-sized  contributions, but made almost no contribution themselves. In Experiment  2, we manipulated expectations experimentally. Participants who moved  simultaneously reciprocated what they expected their partners to do.  Participants who moved pseudo-sequentially defected, regardless of what  they expected from their opponents. Furthermore, we found that  simultaneous movers were more likely than pseudo-sequential movers to  conceptualize themselves and the other player as a group. This sense of  groupness seemed to account partly for their inclination to reciprocate  anticipated behavior.","38":"This  article presents an analysis of 35 years of published experiments  testing decision making in prisoners' dilemmas. The objective is to  begin to reconnect the theory and the evidence of rational behavior by  accumulating the experience of the laboratory and examining this record  for those factors that consistently altered subjects' choices. It is  shown that a model of pure self-interest is usually inconsistent with  the results of experimental decision making, predicting either the wrong  sign, as in the case of monetary stakes, or ignoring influential  variables, such as the content of instructions. This incongruity is  widest with respect to the role of language in encouraging cooperation.","39":"The  fact that people frequently cooperate in the single-trial Prisoner's  Dilemma (PD) game indicates that their decision making in conflicts is  not always guided by game-theoretic analyses of expected outcomes.  Whereas most theorists have accounted for cooperation in terms of an  ethically rooted concern for matching another's \u201cgood faith\u201d cooperation  (Hofstadter, 1985), others have argued that cooperation reflects  several distinct social norms or heuristics (Elster, 1989). In the  latter spirit, the current paper argues that whereas one source of  cooperation is an effort to match cooperation of others, another source  of cooperation is an illusory effort to exert control over others. To  distinguish these social decision heuristics and investigate their  boundary conditions, we test hypotheses about how their occurrence  depends on the timing of decisions in a PD game in which the two players  move on different days. Two experiments consistently supported the  hypothesis that thecontrolheuristic is more frequent when  participants believe that their counterpart's move lies in the future  rather than in the past. Support was also obtained for a second  hypothesis that thematchingheuristic, by contrast, islessfrequent when participants believe that the counterpart's move lies in the future rather than in the past.","40":"We  report results of an experiment in which we examined consumption  behavior of groups of players sharing a common resource pool under four  distinct protocols of play.

We found  a significant \"position effect\" in all three nonsimultaneous protocols:  Mean individual requests and position in the sequence are negatively  correlated, reflecting an \"early mover advantage\" and a \"late mover  handicap.\" The effect is weakest in the positional protocol, whereas the  sequential and cumulative protocols are, practically, identical. We  conclude that although position effects can be induced by temporal  priority, they are primarily driven by differential patterns of  information regarding the behavior of the other group members. Although  the request pattern was consistent with predictions based on the  subjects' social orientation, the differences were not quite as  pronounced (and significant) as in the \"regular\" simultaneous dilemmas.  On the other hand, we found that the subjects' requests in the  simultaneous protocol were an accurate predictor of their behavior in  the other protocols as well.","41":"  Abstract  Experimental games are often used as models of social  dilemmas in which small groups of players have unrestricted access to,  and share, a common and finite resource of desirable goods in the  absence of any binding coordination mechanism. Examples are fishing,  hunting, and use of computational facilities. Experimental studies of  social dilemmas employ different protocols of play  that differ  from each other in terms of the information available to the players  when they register their requests from the common resource. In this  study we focus on the sequential protocol,  where each  participant has complete information about his or her position and the  total requests of the previous movers, and the positional protocol ,  where each player only knows his or her position, but has no  information about the other's requests. Previous research has found a  robust position effect:  individual requests are inversely  related to the players' positions in the sequence with the first mover  requesting most, and the last mover requesting the least. In an attempt  to characterize the nature and intensity of the position effect, we  developed and tested a descriptive model with one free (individual  specific) parameter. The parameter is estimated from the players'  requests under the positional protocol (i.e. in the absence of any  information about the other's requests) and, as such, quantifies the  social norm of \u2018advantage of the early mover\u2019. In a range of cases  examined, including different group sizes, resource pool sizes, and  positions, the model predicted very accurately individuals' requests in  the sequential protocol (with full information about position and  others' requests).

Across both studies, the authors show  that rate of future cooperation is directly related to the number of  best-case scenarios and inversely related to the number of worst-case  scenarios generated.

In Study 1, participants reacted to scenarios describing a  public good social dilemma. For some scenarios there was an equal  distribution of initial resources, while in others the distribution was  unequal. As predicted, group identification led to more cooperation in  the dilemma. Starting with more money tended to reduce group  identification for females but to increase it for males. In Study 2,  participants were faced with an actual one-trial public good social  dilemma involving real money. In some conditions, participants began  with endowments of different sizes, and the inequality was explained as  either random or justified. As predicted, reasons for inequality as well  as the fact of inequality had an impact on group identification which,  in turn, influenced cooperation in the dilemma. Replicating the results  of Study 1, different conditions tended to enhance group identification  for women and men. Study 3 was a conceptual replication of Study 2, and  resulted in similar findings. Overall, these results may have important  implications for real-world dilemmas, where inequality among the parties  is almost always a salient feature.","44":"Highlights\u2022We conduct a truth-telling experiment with a representative population sample at home.\u2022Participants have clear monetary incentives to misreport; detection is impossible.\u2022Aggregate reporting is close to the expected truthful distribution.\u2022Our results suggest that lying costs are strong and widespread.\u2022Additional lab experiments explore what shapes lying costs.AbstractA  central assumption in economics is that people misreport their private  information if this is to their material benefit. Several recent models  depart from this assumption and posit that some people do not lie or at  least do not lie maximally. These models invoke many different  underlying motives including intrinsic lying costs, altruism, efficiency  concerns, or conditional cooperation. To provide an  empirically-validated microfoundation for these models, it is crucial to  understand the relevance of the different potential motives. We measure  the extent of lying costs among a representative sample of the German  population by calling them at home. In our setup, participants have a  clear monetary incentive to misreport, misreporting cannot be detected,  reputational concerns are negligible and altruism, efficiency concerns  or conditional cooperation cannot play a role. Yet, we find that  aggregate reporting behavior is close to the expected truthful  distribution suggesting that lying costs are large and widespread.

However, as altruistic norm compliance and norm enforcement often emerge in the context of inter-group conflicts13,14, they are likely to be shaped by parochialism15\u2014a preference for favouring the members of one's ethnic, racial or language group. We have conducted punishment experiments16,  which allow \u2018impartial\u2019 observers to punish norm violators, with  indigenous groups in Papua New Guinea. Here we show that these  experiments confirm the prediction of parochialism. We found that  punishers protect ingroup victims\u2014who suffer from a norm violation\u2014much  more than they do outgroup victims, regardless of the norm violator's  group affiliation. Norm violators also expect that punishers will be  lenient if the latter belong to their social group. As a consequence,  norm violations occur more often if the punisher and the norm violator  belong to the same group. Our results are puzzling for evolutionary  multi-level selection theories based on selective group extinction2,3,4,5 as well as for theories of individual selection17,18,19;  they also indicate the need to explicitly examine the interactions  between individuals stemming from different groups in evolutionary  models.","49":"['paper', 'examines', 'relationship', 'variations', 'group', 'size', 'free', 'riding', 'behavior', 'voluntary', 'provision', 'public', 'goods', 'examine', 'experimentally', 'two', 'pertinent', 'concepts', 'marginal', 'return', 'individual', 'contributions', 'good', 'actual', 'number', 'members', 'strongly', 'support', 'hypothesis', 'increasing', 'leads', 'reduction', 'allocative', 'efficiency', 'accompanied', 'decrease', 'crowding', 'association', 'large', 'groups', 'imperceptibility', 'benefits', 'pure', 'numbers', 'effect']","50":" Globalization magnifies the problems that affect all people  and that require large-scale human cooperation, for example, the  overharvesting of natural resources and human-induced global warming.  However, what does globalization imply for the cooperation needed to  address such global social dilemmas? Two competing hypotheses are  offered. One hypothesis is that globalization prompts reactionary  movements that reinforce parochial distinctions among people.  Large-scale cooperation then focuses on favoring one's own ethnic,  racial, or language group. The alternative hypothesis suggests that  globalization strengthens cosmopolitan attitudes by weakening the  relevance of ethnicity, locality, or nationhood as sources of  identification. In essence, globalization, the increasing  interconnectedness of people worldwide, broadens the group boundaries  within which individuals perceive they belong. We test these hypotheses  by measuring globalization at both the country and individual levels and  analyzing the relationship between globalization and individual  cooperation with distal others in multilevel sequential cooperation  experiments in which players can contribute to individual, local, and\/or  global accounts. Our samples were drawn from the general populations of  the United States, Italy, Russia, Argentina, South Africa, and Iran. We  find that as country and individual levels of globalization increase,  so too does individual cooperation at the global level vis-\u00e0-vis the  local level. In essence, \u201cglobalized\u201d individuals draw broader group  boundaries than others, eschewing parochial motivations in favor of  cosmopolitan ones. Globalization may thus be fundamental in shaping  contemporary large-scale cooperation and may be a positive force toward  the provision of global public goods.","51":"This  research examined the question of whether the psychology of social  identity can motivate cooperation in the context of a global collective.

Results demonstrate that an inclusive social  identification with the world community is a meaningful psychological  construct that plays a role in motivating cooperation that transcends  parochial interests. Self-reported identification with the world as a  whole predicts behavioral contributions to a global public good beyond  what is predicted from expectations about what other people are likely  to contribute. Furthermore, global social identification is conceptually  distinct from general attitudes about global issues, and has unique  effects on cooperative behavior.","52":"This  paper studies how group identity, social distance and intergroup bias  may affect economic decision-making.

By itself, this evidence does not  demonstrate that exposure to the self-interest model causes more  self-interested behavior, since it may be that economists were simply  more self-interested to begin with, and this difference was one reason  they chose to study economics.

In this paper, we argue that  gender may also influence the degree to which humans act in a  self-interested versus cooperative manner. We test this hypothesis by  replicating the Marwell and Ames experiments using a similar, albeit  simplified, methodology, with a sample of only college students  separated into economists and non-economists. After controlling for  group size, gender, and exposure to economics courses, we find that a  key factor affecting the level of cooperation is gender.

The results, in line with the  proposition, show that the average contribution is significantly larger  in Sweden, implying a higher level of trust and cooperation in Sweden  than in India. This article provides further evidence on the  relationship between trust and economic development.

The pathway by which adaptations for large-scale cooperation  among nonkin evolved in humans remains a subject of vigorous debate.  Results from theoretical analyses and agent-based simulations suggest  that evolutionary dynamics need not yield homogeneous populations, but  can instead generate a polymorphic population that consists of  individuals who vary in their degree of cooperativeness. These results  resonate with the recent increasing emphasis on the importance of  individual differences in understanding and modeling behavior and  dynamics in experimental games and decision problems. Here, we report  the results of laboratory experiments that complement both theory and  simulation results. We find that our subjects fall into three types, an  individual's type is stable, and a group's cooperative outcomes can be  remarkably well predicted if one knows its type composition. Reciprocal  types, who contribute to the public good as a positive function of their  beliefs about others' contributions, constitute the majority (63%) of  players; cooperators and free-riders are also present in our subject  population.

We  introduce a new formal model of social production, called a \u201cGroup-based  Meritocracy Mechanism\u201d (GBM), which extends the single-group-level  analysis of a Voluntary Contribution Mechanism (VCM) to multiple groups.  In a GBM individuals are ranked according to their group contributions.  Based on this ranking, participants are then partitioned into  equal-sized groups. Members of each group share their collective output  equally amongst themselves according to a VCM payoff function. The GBM  has two pure-strategy Nash equilibria.

According to the theory, a persuasive message will influence a  player's behavioral intention (BI), and hence his behavior (B), only if  it affects either A-act, his attitude toward the act, and\/or NBs(Mcs),  his normative beliefs (i,e., his perception of the other player's  expectations), multiplied by his motivation to comply with the norms.  Two types of persuasive messages were given, one directed at A-act, the  other at NBs. Orthogonal to the message type, two motivational  orientations were created, cooperation and competition. Consistent with  earlier findings, A-act was found to be more important than NBs(Mcs) in  predicting BI and B under competition but less important than NBs(Mcs)  under cooperation. It was therefore predicted that the attitudinal  message would change behavior more effectively in the competitive than  in the cooperative situation while the normative message would be more  effective in cooperative than in competitive groups. The results  supported this hypothesis.","93":"Fishbein's (1967) extension of Dulany's (1967)  theory of propositional control was tested in the context of the  Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game. The theory holds that a person's behavior  (B) is a function of his behavioral intention (BI) which is determined  by his attitude toward the act (A-act) and by his beliefs about the  expectations of the other player, i.e., social normative beliefs (NBs).  Two PD games differing in Cooperation Index (CI) were each played in a  cooperative, a competitive, and an individualistic motivational  orientation. CI and motivational orientations affected questionnaire  measures of the theoretical constructs and game behavior as expected.  Their influence on B was mediated by BI through A-act and NBs. BI  correlated highly with B and was in turn accurately predicted from A-act  and NBs in a multiple-regression equation. The relative importance of  A-act and NBs in predicting BI and B varied as expected with the  motivational orientation: in the cooperative condition norms were  relatively more important; under competition more relative weight was  placed on A-act.","94":"nan","95":"nan","96":"\"Ss  played an interprersonal game which, in one position, required them to  choose between being trusting or suspicious of another and, in a second  position, required them to choose between being trustworthy or  untrustworthy toward another.

Specifically, fishermen and traders, who interact in more competitive environments are significantly less cooperative than the coop staff who face little competition on the job.

The experiment consisted of three groups, of which  groups 2 and 3 received one and two treatments, respectively. The first  treatment entailed publicly disclosing the pollution of each member of a  group by placing a corresponding colour-coded card in front of each  subject, while the second involved the withdrawal of the public  disclosure. Group 2 received the first treatment; Group 3 received both  the first and second treatments in succession. We found that the  untreated group (baseline) polluted more than the two treated groups,  and there was no statistically significant difference between the  pollution abatement of the two treated groups. These results suggest  that public disclosure potentially drives pollution abatement and that  its eventual withdrawal does not obliterate abatement behaviour. We did  not observe conditional cooperation but average pollution declined over  time. Furthermore, individuals who thought it was unfair for Africa to  reduce emissions polluted more.

We show that  the decline of cooperation is driven by individual preferences for  imperfect conditional cooperation. Many people's desire to contribute  less than others, rather than changing beliefs of what others will  contribute over time or people's heterogeneity in preferences makes  voluntary cooperation fragile. Universal free riding thus eventually  emerges, despite the fact that most people are not selfish.

We use analysis of variance to disentangle the importance of cultural  background relative to individual heterogeneity and group-level  differences in cooperation. We find that culture has a substantial  influence on the extent of cooperation, in addition to individual  heterogeneity and group-level differences identified by previous  research. The significance of this result is that cultural background  has a substantial influence on cooperation in otherwise identical  environments.

We  hypothesized that this was due to an interaction between personality and  environment. Specifically, we argued that in cooperation-friendly  environments\u2014given certain beliefs\u2014defection is more risky than  cooperation. The main reason for this is that, in such a situation,  defection potentially yields outcomes of higher variance (and vice  versa, for cooperation-unfriendly environments). In line with this  hypothesis, we showed, in two experiments and a reanalysis of a study by  Fudenberg, Rand, and Dreber (American Economic Review, in press),  that the degree of cooperation increases with dispositional risk  aversion in cooperation-friendly environments, but not in  cooperation-unfriendly environments. We also found similar  person\u2013situation interactions for neuroticism and extraversion.","133":"We  apply experimental methods to study the role of risk aversion on  players\u2019 behavior in repeated prisoners\u2019 dilemma games.

Participants were less  generous in the incentivized game. More importantly, personality  predicted decisions only in the incentivized game, with low Neuroticism  and high Openness to Experience predicting more cooperative transfers.  The influence of Neuroticism on behaviour in the incentivized game was  mediated by risk attitude. The results are consistent with other results  suggesting that the Big Five are relevant predictors of moral  behaviour, and with results suggesting that the determinants of  hypothetical decisions are different from the determinants of real  decisions, with the latter being more revealing of one\u2019s true  preferences. The authors argue that psychologists, contrary to  prevailing praxis, should consider making their participants\u2019 decisions  more real.

The  experimental conditions vary group composition along two culturally  inheritable traits (political party preference and religious  affiliation) and one trivial, \u201cminimal\u201d trait (birth season). We  contrast ingroup, outgroup, and random group conditions and investigate  the relation between the own contribution to the public good and the  expectations about other group members' behavior in each one of them. We  find evidence for ingroup favoritism but no support for a separate  tendency towards outgroup hostility. Further, conditional cooperation  and ingroup bias are, to some extent, linked. Subjects had higher  expectations of the contributions of ingroup members, and their own  behavior was more strongly conditioned on other group members' expected  behavior in the ingroup conditions. In ingroup contexts, subjects  displayed a form of \u201cstrong reciprocity\u201d by giving more than they  expected others to at high expectation levels but less at low  expectation levels. Once these interactions are taken into account, we  do not find a direct effect of ingroup bias anymore. We discuss these  results in the light of theories of cultural group selection and  conclude that too much emphasis may have been laid on direct intergroup  conflict. Our results suggest that differential cooperativeness, rather  than parochialism, may characterize the behavior of individuals in  cultural ingroups and outgroups.","136":"Attention  to factors influencing cooperation and competition during human social  interaction has increased within recent years.

Results from multivariate analysis  of variance procedures, cross-lag sequential analyses, and hierarchical  linear modeling supported associations between zygosity, and frequency  and continuity of cooperation.

In three subsequent experiments, implicit priming with the phrase nice act produced greater levels of defection, implying that actors responded to the implicit suggestion that they had been sufficiently nice already. In contrast, act nice produced greater levels of cooperation, implying that actors responded to the implicit suggestion that they should try to be nicer  in upcoming turns.

This inefficiency appears to reflect an  inability to coordinate over how to distribute the cost of providing the  good. So, why do groups not just split the cost equally? We offer an  answer to this question by demonstrating that in a standard threshold  public good game there is no collectively rational recommendation. We  also demonstrate that if full agreement is required in order to provide  the public good then there is a collectively rational recommendation,  namely, to split the cost equally. Requiring full agreement may,  therefore, increase efficiency in providing threshold public goods.

Climate negotiations usually are depicted  as a prisoners\u2019 dilemma game; collectively, countries are better off  reducing their emissions, but self-interest impels them to keep on  emitting. We provide experimental evidence, grounded in an analytical  framework, showing that the fear of crossing a dangerous threshold can  turn climate negotiations into a coordination game, making collective  action to avoid a dangerous threshold virtually assured. These results  are robust to uncertainty about the impact of crossing a threshold, but  uncertainty about the location of the threshold turns the game back into  a prisoners\u2019 dilemma, causing cooperation to collapse. Our research  explains the paradox of why countries would agree to a collective goal,  aimed at reducing the risk of catastrophe, but act as if they were blind  to this risk.","147":"International  efforts to provide global public goods often face the challenges of  coordinating national contributions and distributing costs equitably in  the face of uncertainty, inequality, and free-riding incentives. In an  experimental setting, we distribute endowments unequally among a group  of people who can reach a fixed target sum through successive money  contributions, knowing that if they fail, they will lose all their  remaining money with 50% probability. In some treatments, we give  players the option to communicate intended contributions. We find that  inequality reduces the prospects of reaching the target but that  communication increases success dramatically. Successful groups tend to  eliminate inequality over the course of the game, with rich players  signaling willingness to redistribute early on. Our results suggest that  coordination-promoting institutions and early redistribution from  richer to poorer nations are both decisive for the avoidance of global  calamities, such as disruptive climate change.","148":"Among  the most researched solutions to social dilemmas is communication.

This effect is moderated by the type of communication, with a stronger effect of face-to-face discussion ( d = 1.21) compared to written messages (d  = 0.46). The communication-cooperation relationship is also stronger in  larger, compared to smaller, group social dilemmas. Whether  communication occurred before or during iterated dilemmas did not  statistically affect the communication-cooperation effect size.

Here we present the results of an experiment, rooted in a  game-theoretic model, showing that behaviour differs markedly either  side of a dividing line for threshold uncertainty. On one side of the  dividing line, where threshold uncertainty is relatively large, free  riding proves irresistible and trust illusive, making it virtually  inevitable that the tipping point will be crossed. On the other side,  where threshold uncertainty is small, the incentive to coordinate is  strong and trust more robust, often leading the players to avoid  crossing the tipping point.

If  individuals know how others have contributed, they are able to employ  trigger strategies. Three experimental treatments are used to test our  predictions: (1) no information about other members' contributions, (2)  aggregated information about other members' contributions, and (3)  individualized information about each member's contribution.

This holds under a range of threshold levels and  refund rates. We test if thresholds perform better if they are  endogenously chosen, i.e. if a threshold is approved in a referendum,  because voting may facilitate coordination due to signaling and  commitment effects. We find that voting does have signaling and  commitment effects but they are not strong enough to significantly  improve the efficiency of thresholds.

The introduction of a small membership fee has surprisingly strong  effects: it increases the provision of the collective good, delays  provision failures and increases the number of contributors. The  experiment also reveals the limits of the introduction of a small fee.  At a high threshold level, the membership fee no longer ensures  successful provision.","159":"The  present research examined the assumption that the higher the  probability that decision-makers perceive their contribution to be  critical to the group outcome the higher the chance that they will  contribute.

In line with this, it was  hypothesized that high perceived criticality activates feelings of  social responsibility (which includes an other-oriented approach) and in  turn influences contributions. Across three studies, using a linear  public good dilemma, a step-level dilemma with different monetary  endowments, and a sequential step-level dilemma, supportive evidence for  this hypothesis was found.

Ss later made 50 choices in an  anonymous nonnegotiable game of \"chicken\" in 12-person groups  factorially balanced as to sex and 1\/Nth tendency. As hypothesized, the  choice representing restraint from the desired action was made more  frequently by higher Ss than by lower Ss. There was an indication that  the effect was limited to female Ss.

An index of dilemma, D, is developed to characterize situations  with respect to the degree of conflict between individual and collective  goals. It is hypothesized that group norms and group solidarity are  mechanisms groups devise to increase cooperation in PD-like situations.  In an experiment using a five-person PD game, it is shown that an  increase in D leads to an increase in group friendlines and in attempts  by group members to define the potential noncooperator as immoral and  untrustworthy. Thus, and increase in the potential for conflict within  groups can lead to strengthened group norms and cohesion if this  conflict is of the sort described by the Prisoners' Dilemma. This is  contrary to the prevalent conception that norms arise from an identity  of interests between group members.","173":"Cooperation  between individuals is an important requisite for the maintenance of  social relationships. The purpose of this study was to investigate  cooperation in children in the school environment, where individuals  could cooperate or not with their classmates in a public goods game. We  investigated which of the following variables influenced cooperation in  children: sex, group size, and information on the number of sessions.  Group size was the only factor to significantly affect cooperation, with  small-group children cooperating significantly more than those in large  groups. Both sex and information had no effect on cooperation. We  suggest that these results reflect the fact that, in small groups,  individuals were more efficient in controlling and retaliating theirs  peers than in large groups.","174":"<jats:p>Researchers from across the social sciences have found consistent deviations from the predictions of the canonical model of self-interest in hundreds of experiments from around the world. This research, however, cannot determine whether the uniformity results from universal patterns of human behavior or from the limited cultural variation available among the university students used in virtually all prior experimental work. To address this, we undertook a cross-cultural study of behavior in ultimatum, public goods, and dictator games in a range of small-scale societies exhibiting a wide variety of economic and cultural conditions. We found, first, that the canonical model \u2013 based on self-interest \u2013 fails in all of the societies studied. Second, our data reveal substantially more behavioral variability across social groups than has been found in previous research. Third, group-level differences in economic organization and the structure of social interactions explain a substantial portion of the behavioral variation across societies: the higher the degree of market integration and the higher the payoffs to cooperation in everyday life, the greater the level of prosociality expressed in experimental games. Fourth, the available individual-level economic and demographic variables do not consistently explain game behavior, either within or across groups. Fifth, in many cases experimental play appears to reflect the common interactional patterns of everyday life.<\/jats:p>","175":"The problem of sustaining a public resource that everybody is free to overuse\u2014the \u2018tragedy of the commons\u20191,2,3,4,5,6,7\u2014emerges in many social dilemmas, such as our inability to sustain the global climate. Public goods experiments4,  which are used to study this type of problem, usually confirm that the  collective benefit will not be produced. Because individuals and  countries often participate in several social games simultaneously, the  interaction of these games may provide a sophisticated way by which to  maintain the public resource. Indirect reciprocity8, \u2018give and you shall receive\u2019, is built on reputation and can sustain a high level of cooperation, as shown by game theorists9,10,11.  Here we show, through alternating rounds of public goods and indirect  reciprocity games, that the need to maintain reputation for indirect  reciprocity maintains contributions to the public good at an  unexpectedly high level. But if rounds of indirect reciprocation are not  expected, then contributions to the public good drop quickly to zero.  Alternating the games leads to higher profits for all players. As  reputation may be a currency that is valid in many social games, our  approach could be used to test social dilemmas for their solubility.","176":"This study examined developmental and socioeconomic status (SES) differences in young children's altruistic behavior  in the dictator game (DG).

We  examine whether the participant' sex, the sex composition of the group,  or the resources involved in the social dilemma lead to sex differences  in contributions. Two experiments were employed. Subjects were blocked  on sex and then were assigned randomly to different groups that varied  in sex composition. Although the experiment examined repeated decisions,  no interaction between group members was involved.

We argue that current research has failed  to properly account for the institutional environment and how it  affects the role diversity plays. The emergence of thriving, diverse  communities throughout human history suggests that diversity does not  always lead to cooperation breakdown. We conducted experiments in  Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina with Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks at a  critical historic moment in the city\u2019s postwar history. Using a public  goods game, we found that the ability to sanction is key to achieving  cooperation in ethno-religiously diverse groups, but that sanctions  succeed only in integrated institutional environments and fail in  segregated ones. Hence, we show experimentally for the first time in a  real-life setting that institutions of integration can unleash human  altruism and restore cooperation in the presence of diversity. ","179":" Many people voluntarily incur costs to punish  violations of social norms. Evolutionary models and empirical evidence  indicate that such altruistic punishment has been a decisive force in  the evolution of human cooperation. We used H2 15O  positron emission tomography to examine the neural basis for altruistic  punishment of defectors in an economic exchange. Subjects could punish  defection either symbolically or effectively. Symbolic punishment did  not reduce the defector's economic payoff, whereas effective punishment  did reduce the payoff. We scanned the subjects' brains while they  learned about the defector's abuse of trust and determined the  punishment. Effective punishment, as compared with symbolic punishment,  activated the dorsal striatum, which has been implicated in the  processing of rewards that accrue as a result of goal-directed actions.  Moreover, subjects with stronger activations in the dorsal striatum were  willing to incur greater costs in order to punish. Our findings support  the hypothesis that people derive satisfaction from punishing norm  violations and that the activation in the dorsal striatum reflects the  anticipated satisfaction from punishing defectors. ","180":"Decentralized  groups such as close knit residential neighborhoods and ethnically  linked businesses often achieve high levels of cooperation while  engaging in exclusionary practices that we call parochialism.  We investigate the contribution of within-group cultural affinity to the  ability of parochial groups to cooperate in social dilemmas. We analyze  parochial networks in which the losses incurred by not trading with  outsiders are offset by an enhanced ability to enforce informal  contracts by fostering trust among insiders. We show that there is a  range of degrees of parochialism for which parochial networks can  coexist with an anonymous market offering unrestricted trading  opportunities.","181":"A  symbolic interactionist view of experimental situations suggests that  subjects behave to crate favorable situated identities in Prisoner's  Dilemma Game. The goal-structure of the PDG, being ambiguous, can lead  subjects to play for diverse purposes: to select different strategies to  become \"good players,\" or to define moves as expressive of their  dispositional qualities as \"good persons.\" An experiment was designed to  manipulate goal-ambiguity and the dispositional inferences implied by  different choices. Players saw a hypothetical game between Al and Bob,  whom they characterized on two adjective check-lists, one of which  favored competitive \"player\" qualities, while the other valued  cooperative \"person\" qualities. Subjects then played the game, as had  their Al and Bob examples, for either points or pennies. Both incentive  and list conditiions affected cooperative rates as anticipated, but  unexpected interactions appeared. Apparently, the meaning to play-moves  changed substantially by condition and also varied differentially within  conditions. These variations in the situational meaning of behaviors  are thought to occur routinely in the PDG and other laboratory studies.  They imply a need to revise traditional design and measurement  procedures in social psychological experimentation. These far-reaching  implications are discussed and appraised.","182":"nan","183":"THE  REWARD STRUCTURE OF THE PRISONER'S DILEMMA (PD), AS USUALLY EMPLOYED IN  THE LABORATORY, SEEMS UNREPRESENTATIVE OF MANY REAL-LIFE SITUATIONS THAT  REDUCE ALGEBRAICALLY TO THE PD.

Individuals are endowed with a set of  strategies, and in every round of the game they use one strategy out of  this set based on their memory and learning process. The payoff of a  player using a given strategy depends on the public goods enhancement  factor rr  and the collective action of all players. We investigate the  distribution of used strategies as well as the distribution of  information patterns. The outcome depends on the learning process, which  can be dynamic or static. In the dynamic learning process, the players  can switch their strategies along the whole game, and use the strategy  providing the highest payoff at current time step. In the static  learning process, there is a training period where the players randomly  explore different strategies out of their strategy sets. In the rest of  the game, players only use the strategy providing the highest payoff  during the training period. In the dynamic learning process, we observe a  transition from a non-cooperative regime to a regime where the level of  cooperation reaches about 50%50%.  As in the standard PGG, in the static learning process there is a  transition from the non-cooperative regime to a regime where the level  of cooperation can be higher than 50% at r=Nr=N.  In both learning processes the transition becomes smoother as the  memory size of individuals increases, which means that the lack of  information is a key ingredient causing the defection.","211":"Human  cooperation in social dilemmas challenges researchers from various  disciplines. Here we combine advances in experimental economics and  evolutionary biology that separately have shown that costly punishment  and reputation formation, respectively, induce cooperation in social  dilemmas. The mechanisms of punishment and reputation, however,  substantially differ in their means for \u2018disciplining\u2019 non-cooperators.  Direct punishment incurs salient costs for both the punisher and the  punished, whereas reputation mechanisms discipline by withholding  action, immediately saving costs for the \u2018punisher\u2019. Consequently,  costly punishment may become extinct in environments in which effective  reputation building\u2014for example, through indirect reciprocity\u2014provides a  cheaper and powerful way to sustain cooperation. Unexpectedly, as we  show here, punishment is maintained when a combination with reputation  building is available, however, at a low level. Costly punishment acts  are markedly reduced although not simply substituted by appreciating  reputation. Indeed, the remaining punishment acts are concentrated on  free-riders, who are most severely punished in the combination. When  given a choice, subjects even prefer a combination of reputation  building with costly punishment. The interaction between punishment and  reputation building boosts cooperative efficiency. Because punishment  and reputation building are omnipresent interacting forces in human  societies, costly punishing should appear less destructive without  losing its deterring force.","212":"The  puzzle of the emergence of cooperation between unrelated individuals is  shared across diverse fields of behavioural sciences and economics. In  this article we combine the public goods game originating in economics  with evolutionary approaches traditionally used in biology. Instead of  pairwise encounters, we consider the more complex case of groups of  three interacting individuals. We show that territoriality is capable of  promoting cooperative behaviour, as in the case of the Prisoner's  Dilemma. Moreover, by adding punishment opportunities, the readiness to  cooperate is greatly enhanced and asocial strategies can be largely  suppressed. Finally, as soon as players carry a reputation for being  willing or unwilling to punish, highly cooperative and fair outcomes are  achieved. This group\u2013beneficial result is obtained, intriguingly, by  making individuals more likely to exploit their co\u2013players if they can  get away with it. Thus, less\u2013cooperative individuals make  more-cooperative societies.","213":"In  a public good experiment one group member is replaced by another after a  prespecified number of periods.

A theoretically based typology that  identifies nine systematic patterns associated with changes in group  size and parameters of individual and group payoff structure is  presented. The typology describes nine different ways in which group  size can affect cooperation in the provision of public goods. In a  computer-administered experiment using three of these nine types and  group sizes of three, six, and nine, 90 college students were given  sequences of opportunities to choose between \u201ccooperation\u201d (which  benefited everyone) and \u201cnoncooperation\u201d (which benefited the chooser  but harmed everyone else). For one of these types, a counter-intuitive  but theoretically predicted positive relationship between group size and  cooperation was found.

Under these conditions, selfish players  have enough future benefits to induce subsequent contributions by  reciprocal players, and this incentive diminishes as the end of the game  approaches. The model explains the puzzling restart effect and is  consistent with various other empirical findings.

In contrast, in one-time play against a succession of opponents, noisy payoffs increased cooperation, by slowing the rate at which cooperation decays. These observations are consistent with the robust observation from the psychology literature that partial reinforcement (adding randomness to the link between an action and its consequences while holding expected payoffs constant) slows learning. This effect is magnified in the repeated game: when others are slow to learn to cooperate, the benefits of cooperation are reduced, which further hampers cooperation. These results show that a small change in the payoff environment, which changes the speed of individual learning, can have a large effect on collective behavior. And they show that there may be interesting comparative dynamics that can be derived from careful attention to the fact that at least some economic behavior is learned from experience.

The hired gun mechanism is an example of a low  cost device that promotes complete compliance as the unique Nash  equilibrium. We find that subjects are willing to pay to hire a  delegated policing mechanism over 70% of the time and that this  mechanism increases welfare between 15% and 40%. Moreover, the lion's  share of the welfare gain comes because the hired gun crowds out  vigilante peer-to-peer punishments.Highlights\u25ba  We compare the efficacy of peer punishment to delegated policing by a  \u201chired gun.\u201d \u25ba Subjects pay for the mechanism over 70% of the time with  an associated increase of 15% to 40% in welfare. \u25ba The welfare gain is  largely because the hired gun crowds out peer-punishments.","258":"nan","259":"We  present the results of an experiment that explores the sanctioning  behavior of individuals who experience a social dilemma. In the game we  study, players choose contribution levels to a public good and  subsequently have multiple opportunities to reduce the earnings of the  other members of the group. The treatments vary in terms of individuals\u2019  opportunities to (a) avenge sanctions that have been directed toward  themselves, and (b) punish others\u2019 sanctioning behavior with respect to  third parties. We find that individuals do avenge sanctions they have  received, and this serves to decrease contribution levels. They also  punish those who fail to sanction third parties, but the resulting  increase in contributions is smaller than the decrease the avenging of  sanctions induces. When there are five rounds of unrestricted  sanctioning, contributions and welfare are significantly lower than when  only one round of sanctioning opportunities exists, and welfare is  lower than at a benchmark of zero cooperation.","260":"Social  sanctioning is widely considered a successful strategy to promote  cooperation among humans. In situations in which individual and  collective interests are at odds, incentives to free-ride induce  individuals to refrain from contributing to public goods provision.  Experimental evidence from public goods games shows that when endowed  with sanctioning powers, conditional cooperators can discipline  defectors, thus leading to greater levels of cooperation. However,  extant evidence is based on peer punishment institutions, whereas in  complex societies, systems of control are often centralized: for  instance, we do not sanction our neighbors for driving too fast, the  police do. Here we show the effect of centralized sanctioning and  legitimate authority on cooperation. We designed an adaptation of the  public goods game in which sanctioning power is given to a single  monitor, and we experimentally manipulated the process by which the  monitor is chosen. To increase the external validity of the study, we  conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 1,543 Ugandan farmers  from 50 producer cooperatives. This research provides evidence of the  effectiveness of centralized sanctioning and demonstrates the causal  effect of legitimacy on cooperation: participants are more responsive to  the authority of an elected monitor than a randomly chosen monitor. Our  essay contributes to the literature on the evolution of cooperation by  introducing the idea of role differentiation. In complex societies,  cooperative behavior is not only sustained by mechanisms of selection  and reciprocity among peers, but also by the legitimacy that certain  actors derive from their position in the social hierarchy.","261":"Much  of human cooperation remains an evolutionary riddle. Unlike other  animals, people frequently cooperate with non-relatives in large groups.  Evolutionary models of large-scale cooperation require not just  incentives for cooperation, but also a credible disincentive for free  riding. Various theoretical solutions have been proposed and  experimentally explored, including reputation monitoring and diffuse  punishment. Here, we empirically examine an alternative theoretical  proposal: responsibility for punishment can be borne by one specific  individual. This experiment shows that allowing a single individual to  punish increases cooperation to the same level as allowing each group  member to punish and results in greater group profits. These results  suggest a potential key function of leadership in human groups and  provides further evidence supporting that humans will readily and  knowingly behave altruistically.","262":"We  study a voluntary contributions mechanism in which punishment may be  allowed, depending on subjects\u2019 voted rules.

Over a series of  votes and periods of learning we found a distinct reluctance to allow  any punishment at the beginning, with a gradual but clear evolution  toward allowing punishment of low contributors. And groups allowing  punishment of only low contributors achieved levels of cooperation and  efficiency that are among the highest in the literature on social  dilemmas.","263":"Discusses  the limitations of the rational-structural and goal\/expectation  approaches to the problem of public goods (PGs), presents a new  approach\u2014the structural goal\/expectation approach\u2014intended to overcome  these limitations, and tested 4 predictions derived from the new  approach in a study of 48 4-person groups of undergraduates. According  to this new approach, members who have realized the undesirable  consequence of free riding and the importance of mutual cooperation will  cooperate to establish a sanctioning system that assures other members'  cooperation instead of trying to induce other members into mutual  cooperation directly through cooperative actions. One important  condition for their voluntary cooperation in the establishment of a  sanctioning system is their realization that voluntarily based  cooperation is impossible. In the study, each member of the group was  given resource money that they could keep for themselves or contribute  to the provision of a PG. The increase in the personal benefit due to  one's contribution was reduced to zero, and Ss were not allowed to see  each other in person. Some groups were given opportunities to develop a  negative sanctioning system that punished the least cooperative group  member. The level of punishment depended on the total amount of  contribution made by the group members to the sanctioning system, which  was separate from the contribution to the original PG. Results support  the approach's predictions.

Understanding when and why it occurs is important both for the design of  economic institutions and for modeling the evolution of cooperation.  Our experiment shows that subjects will engage in costly punishment even  when it will not be observed until the end of the session, which  supports the view that agents enjoy punishment. Moreover, players  continue to cooperate when punishment is unobserved, perhaps because  they (correctly) anticipate that shirkers will be punished: Fear of  punishment can be as effective at promoting contributions as punishment  itself.","265":"This  is a study about the possibility of self-governance.

We report an experiment in which players can  issue non\u2010binding threats to punish others based on their contribution  levels to a public good. After observing others' actual contributions,  they choose their actual punishment level. We find that threats increase  the level of contributions significantly. Efficiency is improved, but  only in the latter periods.

However, when we hone the  mechanism to eliminate all but one of the provision-point equilibria,  thereby addressing the coordination issue, the mechanism moves all  subjects to the desired efficient outcome almost immediately. In fact,  after only one round using the hired gun mechanism, all subject are  coordinating on the chosen equilibrium. The mechanism can be applied in  settings where a group (1)\u00a0has a plan for public good provision,  (2)\u00a0can measure contributions, (3)\u00a0can fine members and  (4)\u00a0has an agreed upon standard for expected contributions.

Participants interacted over 30 rounds in fixed groups  with fixed identifiers that allowed them to trace other group members'  behavior over time. The two dimensions of communication we study are  asking for a specific contribution level and having to express oneself  when choosing to counter-punish. We conduct four experimental  treatments, all involving a contribution stage, a punishment stage, and a  counter-punishment stage in each round. In the first treatment  communication is not possible at any of the stages. The second treatment  allows participants to ask for a contribution level at the punishment  stage and in the third treatment participants are required to send a  message if they decide to counter-punish. The fourth combines the two  communication channels of the second and third treatments. We find that  the three treatments involving communication at any of the two relevant  stages lead to significantly higher contributions than the baseline  treatment. We find no difference between the three treatments with  communication. We also relate our results to previous results from  treatments without counter-punishment opportunities and do not find that  the presence of counter-punishment leads to lower cooperation level.

We tend to help others even if costs are involved. We are more likely  to help when the costs are small and the benefits for the other person  significant. Cooperation leads to a tension between what is best for the  individual and what is best for the group. A group does better if  everyone cooperates, but each individual is tempted to defect. Recently  there has been much interest in exploring the effect of costly  punishment on human cooperation8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.  Costly punishment means paying a cost for another individual to incur a  cost. It has been suggested that costly punishment promotes cooperation  even in non-repeated games and without any possibility of reputation  effects10.  But most of our interactions are repeated and reputation is always at  stake. Thus, if costly punishment is important in promoting cooperation,  it must do so in a repeated setting. We have performed experiments in  which, in each round of a repeated game, people choose between  cooperation, defection and costly punishment. In control experiments,  people could only cooperate or defect. Here we show that the option of  costly punishment increases the amount of cooperation but not the  average payoff of the group. Furthermore, there is a strong negative  correlation between total payoff and use of costly punishment. Those  people who gain the highest total payoff tend not to use costly  punishment: winners don\u2019t punish. This suggests that costly punishment  behaviour is maladaptive in cooperation games and might have evolved for  other reasons.","282":"The  existence of cooperation and social order among genetically unrelated  individuals is a fundamental problem in the behavioural sciences. The  prevailing approaches in biology and economics view cooperation  exclusively as self-interested behaviour\u2014unrelated individuals cooperate  only if they face economic rewards or sanctions rendering cooperation a  self-interested choice. Whether economic incentives are perceived as  just or legitimate does not matter in these theories. Fairness-based  altruism is, however, a powerful source of human cooperation. Here we  show experimentally that the prevailing self-interest approach has  serious shortcomings because it overlooks negative effects of sanctions  on human altruism. Sanctions revealing selfish or greedy intentions  destroy altruistic cooperation almost completely, whereas sanctions  perceived as fair leave altruism intact. These findings challenge  proximate and ultimate theories of human cooperation that neglect the  distinction between fair and unfair sanctions, and they are probably  relevant in all domains in which voluntary compliance matters\u2014in  relations between spouses, in the education of children, in business  relations and organizations as well as in markets.","283":"A  normative conflict arises when multiple plausible rules exist,  specifying how one ought to behave in a given situation. In such cases,  enforcing one normative rule can lead to a sequence of mutual  retaliatory sanctions, which we refer to as a feud. We  investigate the hypothesis that normative conflict enhances the  likelihood of a feud in a public-good experiment. Normative conflict in  our experiment arises from the fact that individuals derive different  benefits from the public good. We find that punishment is much more  likely to trigger counter-punishment and start a feud when there is a  normative conflict, than it is in a setting in which all individuals  derive the same benefit from the public good and no such conflict  exists. While the possibility of a feud sustains cooperation, the cost  of feuding fully offsets the efficiency gains from increased  cooperation.

Previous evidence suggests that the costs of peer punishment can be  outweighed by the benefits of higher cooperation if (i) there is a  sufficiently long time horizon and (ii) punishment cannot be avenged.  However, in most instances in daily life, when individuals interact for  an extended period of time, punishment can be retaliated. We use a  design that imposes minimal restrictions on who can punish whom or when,  and allows participants to employ a wide range of punishment strategies  including retaliation of punishment. Similar to previous research, we  find that, when punishment cannot be avenged, peer punishment leads to  higher earnings relative to a baseline treatment without any punishment  opportunities.

Theorists have identified competing mechanisms for  facilitating group cooperation, including group identity, sanctions and  reciprocity. Here I use empirical data to explore how these mechanisms  influence cooperation in the natural laboratory of microcredit borrowing  groups. Microcredit makes loans to high-risk borrowers through  borrowing groups in which individuals' access to credit is dependent on  the behavior of other members of the group, thereby creating a social  dilemma for members and an opportunity to observe cooperation in real  world groups. By analyzing both collective goods production (loans) and  compliance (repayment), I find that the competing mechanisms have  differential effects. Group identity, sanctions and reciprocity are all  associated with more borrowing in the group. Only reciprocity, however,  limits loan delinquency and is associated with group longevity,  suggesting both that collective goods production is a distinct process  from group compliance over time, and that reciprocity may be an  important mechanism in both processes. I discuss how these findings  contribute to our understanding of group cooperation, as well as the  implications for the related theoretical concept of embeddedness.","293":"We  develop and test a theory of relational cohesion, which predicts how  and when people in exchange become committed to their relationship. The  theory focuses on dyads within networks and predicts that more equal  power and greater \"total,\" or mutual, power promote exchanges that  arouse positive emotions and create perceptions of the relation as a  cohesive unit. The behavioral consequences are a tendency for actors to  (1) stay in the exchange relation despite attractive alternatives, (2)  provide each other token gifts, and (3) contribute to a new joint  venture. Three laboratory experiments test and support the theory. Our  results suggest that complementary emotional\/affective and  uncertainty-reduction processes explain the effect of repetitive  exchanges on commitment formation.

A more complete  understanding of generalized exchange requires that the underlying  social dilemma in such situations be appreciated fully. This paper  represents our initial efforts to bridge two research  traditions-research on social exchange and research on social dilemmas.  This synthesis also may be of value to cholars interested in social  dilemmas. With few exceptions, research in this tradition often ignores  the internal structure of the social contexts in which such dilemmas  arise. We present the results of a series of experimental studies. The  findings suggest that \"network-generalized\" exchange systems promote  higher levels of participation (or cooperation) than do  \"group-generalized\" exchange systems, regardless of the size of the  network or group. In addition, mutual trust promotes a higher level of  participation, especially in network-generalized exchange systems.","296":"Does  gender affect cooperation? In this paper we analyze the effects of  gender and group gender composition on prosocial behavior. We make two  competing predictions: one based on literature suggesting that women are  more cooperative than men, the other building on research regarding the  effect of expectations on behavior. Using data drawn from micro-credit  borrowing groups, we find that gender composition, not gender per se, is  correlated with the likelihood that individuals will default on loan  payments. The findings suggest that behavior which might appear to be a  consequence of inherent gender differences more likely results from  expectations associated with group gender composition.","297":"['cooperation', 'reciprocal', 'altruism', 'evolved', 'small', 'number', 'species', 'yet', 'constitutes', 'core', 'behavioral', 'principle', 'human', 'social', 'life', 'iterated', 'prisoner', 'dilemma', 'game', 'model', 'form', 'fmri', 'scan', '36', 'women', 'played', 'another', 'woman', 'investigate', 'neurobiological', 'basis', 'cooperative', 'behavior', 'mutual', 'consistent', 'activation', 'brain', 'areas', 'linked', 'reward', 'processing', 'nucleus', 'accumbens', 'caudate', 'ventromedial', 'frontal', 'orbitofrontal', 'cortex', 'rostral', 'anterior', 'cingulate', 'propose', 'neural', 'network', 'positively', 'reinforces', 'thereby', 'motivating', 'subjects', 'resist', 'temptation', 'selfishly', 'accept', 'reciprocate', 'favors']","298":"Recent  research suggests that group discussion of a social dilemma may  increase cooperative behavior because group members honor the  commitments they make during the group discussion.

Experiment 1 replicated and extended previous research showing  that the anonymity of one's cooperative\/noncooperative choice does not  moderate the effect of group discussion. Experiment 2 examined the  possibility that commitments to cooperate were kept due to mindless  adherence to a prior decision, rather than to an internalized norm.  Contrary to the former possibility, enhancing mindfulness did not  moderate the effect of group discussion. The scope and implications of  personal norms of commitment are discussed.","299":"Data  from two experimental social dilemmas-a set of 66 nine-person dilemmas  and a set of 64 seven-person dilemmas-were used to examine sex  differences in cooperation. Women were only slightly more likely than  men to cooperate with others, and variables related to the experimental  setting were much more important influences on behavior than sex.  Whether or not the women cooperated, they were more likely than men to  justify their behavior as being altruistic and principled, to believe  that they were more oriented toward harmonious group relations, and to  be less nervous and upset at the end of the experiment. It is suggested  that those who speculate on sex differences in cooperation may have  overstated these differences and that the relationship between  self-schema and behavior may vary depending on the extent to which the  attributes studied relate to gender identity.","300":"Three  studies were conducted to determine the effects of observing the  behaviors of others upon an individual's actions in a simulated social  trap situation. In Experiment 1, it was found that merely having the  opportunity to make comparative appraisals of the actions of others led  to greater competition for a finite common resource than when subjects  were physically isolated from one another. In Experiment 2, false  feedback was given to subjects to determine if the actions of others  alone were responsible for the deleterious effects of having the  opportunity for comparative appraisal; it was found that subjects  quickly conformed to the behavior pattern of the interacting others,  regardless of whether the false feedback indicated that the other  subjects were consuming more or less than no-treatment control subjects.  Experiment 3 was conducted to determine the motivation of subjects  reacting to the actions of others; differential predictions based upon a  competition\/relative outcome explanation and upon an information search  explanation were made. The data were consistent with the information  search explanation.","301":"Highlights\u2022We study contributions and punishments in a linear public good game.\u2022We manipulate the endowment sources of group members.\u2022Endowment source manipulation fails to generate a normative conflict.\u2022Contributions and punishments are similar across control and treatment groups.\u2022In treatment groups, effort exerted to earn the endowments makes punishment (slightly) less severe.AbstractThis  paper studies contributions and punishments in a linear public good  game, where group members have different sources of endowment. We  compare the behavior of homogeneous groups, in which subjects are  exogenously assigned the same endowments, with that of heterogeneous  groups, in which half the group members have to exert effort to earn  their endowments (effort subjects) and the other half are endowed with a  windfall of equal value (windfall subjects).If the opportunity to punish is absent, free-riding  becomes the ubiquitous form of behavior over time both in homogeneous  and in heterogeneous groups. If the opportunity to punish is present,  contributions increase over time, although the two groups do not exhibit  any differences in either the amount of contributions or the amount of  punishment. Furthermore, effort and windfall subjects make similar  contributions in heterogeneous groups.Within the  heterogeneous groups, over the entire time interval and conditional on  the decision to punish, effort subjects punish (slightly) less severely  than those who received windfall endowments.","302":"We  conduct experiments on earned wealth effects in dictator games. In  addition to a standard treatment in which wealth was determined by the  experimenter, we conduct treatments in which the dictator or the  receiver earned the wealth used in the dictator game. In our baseline  treatment, on average, dictators allocate receivers 20 percent. In  treatments where dictators earned wealth, we observe the (theoretically  predicted) zero offers to receivers. In treatments where receivers  earned wealth, we observe distributions of offers in which receivers\u2019  shares exceeds 50 percent.

This paper examines the extent to which  sanction works in this scenario by varying marginal per capita return  (MPCR) among group members. Experimental results indicate that in the  absence of sanctions, productivity heterogeneity hampers cooperation.  Allowing punishment in these groups significantly enhances average  contributions of group members, but does not increase welfare. In groups  in which cooperation is highly successful, high-productivity agents  actively punish low-productivity agents in initial periods. However,  conditional on individual contributions, high-productivity agents  receive more punishment, and behave more responsively by raising their  contributions in the next period. The results mirror the reality in  which elites in a society are under higher pressure, since their choices  are likely to have a deeper impact on a society.","305":"We  find an \u201cinverse found money effect\u201d in two-person public good  experiments in which individuals earning their endowments contribute  more and engage in \u201caltruistic conditional cooperation\u201d when they are  matched with those whose endowment is provided by the experimenters.","306":"Public  good games provide an experimental environment for the study of social  dilemmas. Typically, participants receive their endowments for the game  from the experimenter. However, what if these endowments were earned  rather than given as windfalls? Does the level of effort to earn the  endowments influence contributions to the public good? Participants (n  = 83) in a 2-stage experiment were required to earn their endowments  through making either greater or lesser efforts. They were subsequently  asked to play a linear public good game with the money. In contrast to  the majority of previous studies undertaken, the participants in this  experiment were not informed as to the asymmetry of the origin of the  endowment. The results showed that contributions to the public good were  less if endowments were earned with greater effort rather than with  lesser effort.

The games differ with respect to positive and negative  outcomes, whether they are played simultaneously or sequentially and  whether one or the other person is allowed to play the sequential game  first. The observed strategies of 52 participants playing these games in  a computer experiment are explained by the values of the payoffs, the  expectations regarding the other person's moves and by personal  information. It appears that a subjective expected utility model can be  used to test different psychological models of choice. A model assuming  segregated evaluation of the payoffs in the sequential games gives a  better explanation of the choices than a model assuming integration of  payoffs. This implies some rules for giving rewards for behavior in the  social dilemma situations concerned.","308":"The  Prisoners' Dilemma is reformulated as a game (with incomplete  information) between players of different \u2018moral standards\u2019. Equilibrium  solutions are computed for games with simultaneous choices and for  games with sequential choices. Cooperation should occur more frequently  in the latter. Experiments are conducted with both types of games. The  results can neither be explained by (linear) altruistic utility  functions nor by a revaluation of the cooperative choices. They can be  explained, however, by a revaluation of the cooperative result. In this  case we get an extreme distribution of the \u2018moral standards\u2019. Expressed  as monetary values and compared with the monetary rewards of the game  there seems to be one class of persons with rather high standards,  another class of persons with rather low standards, and practically no  intermediate cases.

Behavioral and questionnaire  data converged on a motivational explanation of the differences among  the games. The 2 games that produced cooperative behavior in the earlier  study apparently elicit a relatively durable desire for cooperation  from the other player. The game that previously produced noncooperation  apparently elicits a desire for the payoff associated with mutual  noncooperation and a fragile interest in fair division. These motives  can be traced to features of the reward structure of the games.

Usually, information about prospective counterparts  is incomplete, often being limited to an average success rate.  Uncertainty on reputation is further increased by fraud, which is  increasingly becoming a cause of concern. To address these issues, we  have designed an experiment based on the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma as a model  for social interactions. Participants could spend money to have their  observable cooperativeness increased. We find that the aggregate  cooperation level is practically unchanged, i.e., global behavior does  not seem to be affected by unreliable reputations. However, at the  individual level we find two distinct types of behavior, one of reliable  subjects and one of cheaters, where the latter artificially fake their  reputation in almost every interaction. Cheaters end up being better off  than honest individuals, who not only keep their true reputation but  are also more cooperative. In practice, this results in honest subjects  paying the costs of fraud as cheaters earn the same as in a truthful  environment. These findings point to the importance of ensuring the  truthfulness of reputation for a more equitable and fair society.","311":"Human  populations are both highly cooperative and highly organized. Human  interactions are not random but rather are structured in social  networks. Importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic,  changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. This  dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that  has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical  attention: People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those  around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we present  experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation and  dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize  cooperation in sizable groups. Our experiments explore large-scale  cooperation, where subjects\u2019 cooperative actions are equally beneficial  to all those with whom they interact. Consistent with previous research,  we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are  shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We also  find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently,  cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their network  connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different outcome:  Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network rewiring.  Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and form new links  with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate and leading to  substantial changes in network structure. Our experiments confirm the  predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models and  demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks can play in  supporting large-scale human cooperation.","312":"It  is not fully understood why we cooperate with strangers on a daily  basis. In an increasingly global world, where interaction networks and  relationships between individuals are becoming more complex, different  hypotheses have been put forward to explain the foundations of human  cooperation on a large scale and to account for the true motivations  that are behind this phenomenon. In this context, population structure  has been suggested to foster cooperation in social dilemmas, but  theoretical studies of this mechanism have yielded contradictory results  so far; additionally, the issue lacks a proper experimental test in  large systems. We have performed the largest experiments to date with  humans playing a spatial Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma on a lattice and a  scale-free network (1,229 subjects). We observed that the level of  cooperation reached in both networks is the same, comparable with the  level of cooperation of smaller networks or unstructured populations. We  have also found that subjects respond to the cooperation that they  observe in a reciprocal manner, being more likely to cooperate if, in  the previous round, many of their neighbors and themselves did so, which  implies that humans do not consider neighbors\u2019 payoffs when making  their decisions in this dilemma but only their actions. Our results,  which are in agreement with recent theoretical predictions based on this  behavioral rule, suggest that population structure has little relevance  as a cooperation promoter or inhibitor among humans.","313":"The  natural tendency for humans to make and break relationships is thought  to facilitate the emergence of cooperation. In particular, allowing  conditional cooperators to choose with whom they interact is believed to  reinforce the rewards accruing to mutual cooperation while  simultaneously excluding defectors. Here we report on a series of human  subjects experiments in which groups of 24 participants played an  iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma game where, critically, they were also  allowed to propose and delete links to players of their own choosing at  some variable rate. Over a wide variety of parameter settings and  initial conditions, we found that dynamic partner updating significantly  increased the level of cooperation, the average payoffs to players, and  the assortativity between cooperators. Even relatively slow update  rates were sufficient to produce large effects, while subsequent  increases to the update rate had progressively smaller, but still  positive, effects. For standard prisoner\u2019s dilemma payoffs, we also  found that assortativity resulted predominantly from cooperators  avoiding defectors, not by severing ties with defecting partners, and  that cooperation correspondingly suffered. Finally, by modifying the  payoffs to satisfy two novel conditions, we found that cooperators did  punish defectors by severing ties, leading to higher levels of  cooperation that persisted for longer.","314":"In  an otherwise neutrally described Prisoners\u02bc dilemma experiment, we  document that behavior is more likely to be cooperative when the game is  called the Community Game than when it is called the Stock Market Game.  However, the difference vanishes when only one of the subjects is in  control of her action. The social framing effect also vanishes when the  game is played sequentially. These findings are inconsistent with the  hypothesis that the Community label triggers a desire to cooperate, but  consistent with the hypothesis that social frames are coordination  devices. More generally, our evidence indicates that social frames enter  people\u02bcs beliefs rather than their preferences.Highlights\u25ba  We present three theories for why social framing, such as the mere  naming of the game, may affect behavior. \u25ba We conduct three Prisoners\u02bc  Dilemma experiments. \u25ba The evidence indicates that social framing  primarily affects beliefs, not preferences.","315":"<jats:p>The emergence and sustenance of cooperative behavior is fundamental for a society to thrive. Recent experimental studies have shown that cooperation increases in dynamic networks in which subjects can choose their partners. However, these studies did not vary reputational knowledge, or what subjects know about other\u2019s past actions, which has long been recognized as an important factor in supporting cooperation. They also did not give subjects access to global social knowledge, or information on who is connected to whom in the group. As a result, it remained unknown how reputational and social knowledge foster cooperative behavior in dynamic networks both independently and by complementing each other. In an experimental setting, we show that global reputational knowledge is crucial to sustaining a high level of cooperation and welfare. Cooperation is associated with the emergence of dense and clustered networks with highly cooperative hubs. Global social knowledge has no effect on the aggregate level of cooperation. A community analysis shows that the addition of global social knowledge to global reputational knowledge affects the distribution of cooperative activity: cooperators form a separate community that achieves a higher cooperation level than the community of defectors. Members of the community of cooperators achieve a higher payoff from interactions within the community than members of the less cooperative community.<\/jats:p>","316":"Cooperation  in one-shot anonymous interactions is a widely documented aspect of  human behaviour. Here we shed light on the motivations behind this  behaviour by experimentally exploring cooperation in a one-shot  continuous-strategy Prisoner's Dilemma (i.e. one-shot two-player Public  Goods Game). We examine the distribution of cooperation amounts and how  that distribution varies based on the benefit-to-cost ratio of  cooperation (b\/c). Interestingly, we find a trimodal distribution at all b\/c values investigated. Increasing b\/c  decreases the fraction of participants engaging in zero cooperation and  increases the fraction engaging in maximal cooperation, suggesting a  role for efficiency concerns. However, a substantial fraction of  participants consistently engage in 50% cooperation regardless of b\/c.  The presence of these persistent 50% cooperators is surprising and not  easily explained by standard models of social preferences. We present  evidence that this behaviour is a result of social preferences guided by  simple decision heuristics, rather than the rational examination of  payoffs assumed by most social preference models. We also find a strong  correlation between play in the Prisoner's Dilemma and in a subsequent  Dictator Game, confirming previous findings suggesting a common  prosocial motivation underlying altruism and cooperation.","317":"Social  dilemmas are central to human society. Depletion of natural resources,  climate protection, security of energy supply and workplace  collaborations are all examples of social dilemmas. Since cooperative  behaviour in a social dilemma is individually costly, Nash equilibrium  predicts that humans should not cooperate. Yet experimental studies show  that people do cooperate even in anonymous one-shot interactions. In  spite of the large number of participants in many modern social  dilemmas, little is known about the effect of group size on cooperation.  Does larger group size favour or prevent cooperation? We address this  problem both experimentally and theoretically. Experimentally, we find  that there is no general answer: it depends on the strategic situation.  Specifically, we find that larger groups are more cooperative in the  Public Goods game, but less cooperative in the N-person Prisoner's  dilemma. Theoretically, we show that this behaviour is not consistent  with either the Fehr &amp; Schmidt model or (a one-parameter version of)  the Charness &amp; Rabin model, but it is consistent with the  cooperative equilibrium model introduced by the second author.","318":"Understanding  human cooperation is of major interest across the natural and social  sciences. But it is unclear to what extent cooperation is actually a  general concept. Most research on cooperation has implicitly assumed  that a person\u2019s behaviour in one cooperative context is related to their  behaviour in other settings, and at later times. However, there is  little empirical evidence in support of this assumption. Here, we  provide such evidence by collecting thousands of game decisions from  over 1,400 individuals. A person\u2019s decisions in different cooperation  games are correlated, as are those decisions and both self-report and  real-effort measures of cooperation in non-game contexts. Equally strong  correlations exist between cooperative decisions made an average of 124  days apart. Importantly, we find that cooperation is not  correlated with norm-enforcing punishment or non-competitiveness. We  conclude that there is a domain-general and temporally stable  inclination towards paying costs to benefit others, which we dub the  \u2018cooperative phenotype\u2019.","319":"Despite  a large theoretical and empirical literature on public goods and  common-pool resources, a systematic comparison of these two types of  social dilemmas is lacking. In fact, there is some confusion about these  two types of dilemma situations. As a result, they are often treated  alike. In line with the theoretical literature, the authors argue that  the degree of rivalry is the fundamental difference between the two  games. Furthermore, they experimentally study behavior in a quadratic  public good and a quadratic common-pool resource game with identical  Pareto-optimum but divergent interior Nash equilibria. The results show  that participants clearly perceive the differences in rivalry. Aggregate  behavior in both games starts relatively close to Pareto efficiency and  converges quickly to the respective Nash equilibrium.","320":"Social  interactions are frequently associated with social approval.  Anticipation of social sanctions may have important economic  consequences, in particular in the realm of collective action and  voluntary cooperation. This paper investigates the impact and the  limitations of social rewards on people\u2019s behavior in the provision of a  public good. We examine whether the opportunity to receive social  approval in exchange for participation in collective actions is capable  of overcome free-riding. We find that approval incentives alone are not  sufficiently strong to cause a reduction in free-riding. However, in  combination with some minimal social familiarity approval incentives  generate a significant rise in cooperation. Our results also suggest  that approval incentives give rise to multiple equilibria.","321":"An  experimental analysis of voluntary, binary contributions for step-level  public goods\/bads is presented. Alternatively, the situation is  presented as the provision of a public good or the prevention of a  public bad. From a strategic point of view these presentations are  equivalent. In early periods of the 20 round experiments, behavior is  indeed observed to be similar in both cases, but after about 5 periods  differences start to occur, that grow larger. A simple learning model is  developed that replicates the patterns in the experiments.  Extrapolation beyond 20 periods show that the pattern observed reflects  an equilibrium selection.","322":"We  study a class of multi-level collective actions, in which each  individual is simultaneously engaged in an intragroup conflict and  intergroup competition. The intragroup conflict is modeled as an n-person  Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game, in which the dominant strategy is to  contribute nothing. The intergroup competition is for an exogenous and  commonly known prize shared by members of the winning group. We focus on  the effects on the level of contribution of the two most common sharing  rules for dividing the prize, equal and proportional. Our results show  that (1) embedding the intragroup conflict in intergroup competition  markedly reduces free riding; (2) the proportional profit sharing rule  significantly outperforms the egalitarian rule, and the difference  between the two increases with experience; (3) under egalitarian but not  under proportional sharing, there is over-contribution compared to  theoretical predictions, and (4) a simple reinforcement-based learning  model accounts for the aggregate results of all five experimental  conditions.","323":"Experiments  are reported that add to the growing literature on the voluntary  provision of public goods.

Further, by  examining designs with an interior Nash equilibrium, this research  suggests that the non-zero contributions observed in the previous  dominant strategy environments, where the prediction was a zero level of  provision of the public good, were not simply transitional errors as  the system converged to a boundary equilibrium.","324":"Previous  research on asymmetric social dilemmas has suggested that public good  dilemmas evoke different choice behaviors than do resource dilemmas. The  authors propose that these differences reflect a differential focus  that is dependent on the way decisions are generally presented in the  dilemma types. In agreement with this, the results of 2 experimental  studies suggest that, in public good dilemmas, group members are less  focused on the consequences of their actions for the final outcome  distribution when deciding how many endowments they give to the public  good than when deciding how many endowments they keep for themselves. In  resource dilemmas, group members are less focused on the final outcome  distribution when deciding how many endowments they leave in the  collective resource than when deciding how many endowments they take.

After an analysis of the information needed to implement  such coordination rules, a framework is presented to predict effects of  environmental uncertainty in social dilemmas.

Results of both experiments indicate that when tacitly  coordinating choice behavior, group members tend to rely solely on the  environmental information they are certain about. More specifically, the  results indicate that effects of environmental uncertainty are  dependent on the dilemma type, the type of asymmetry, and the type of  uncertainty group members are facing.","326":"We  examine whether public goods and common pool resources generate  equivalent levels of cooperation when the payoffs are the same. Two  theoretical perspectives seem to contradict each other on the  equivalence issue. Prospect theory implies that settings involving  common pool resources should generate higher levels of cooperation than  settings involving public goods; expected utility theory implies that  the two settings should generate the same levels of cooperation. We  conduct three experiments to examine the predictions of nonequivalence  by prospect theory, and find that common pool resources generate higher  levels of cooperation on first trials in both static and dynamic  contexts. If no interaction with other group members is added, the  higher leves of cooperation in resource settings remain in static  settings. In dynamic settings, however, where resourse itself changes,  the higher levels of cooperation in resorce settings are short-lived. In  both dynamic and static settings, the addition of group interaction  seems to eliminate the initial differences in levels of cooperation.","327":"Considered  in this paper is a class of social dilemma situations in which subjects  are instructed that there is a certain amount of money, x,  that can be made available to them collectively and all they have to do  is to request, individually and anonymously, how much money they, as  individuals, want.

Three independent variables were manipulated: (a)  level of resource replenishment, (b) group communication prior to  decision making, and (c) access to the resource. Our findings indicated  strong support for the hypothesized effect of communication and moderate  support for the effect of resource distribution. Results suggest that a  decline in scarcity increases cooperation only when groups are allowed  to communicate and when there is equal access to resources.

We  found that subjects harvested more from the resource in abundance than  in scarcity conditions.

This research also examined whether the salience, or strength, of two  different motives for defection varied with the situation. When there  was high resource inequality, it was hypothesized that the salience of  each motive would depend on the amount of resources a person could  contribute to a public good. The results strongly supported the  hypothesis that inequality leads to decreased cooperation, but provided  no support for the effects of framing and voice.

Deliberation, by contrast, adjusts  behaviour towards the optimum for a given situation. Thus, in one-shot  anonymous interactions where selfishness is optimal, intuitive responses  tend to be more cooperative than deliberative responses. We test this  \u2018social heuristics hypothesis\u2019 by aggregating across every cooperation  experiment using time pressure that we conducted over a 2-year period  (15 studies and 6,910 decisions), as well as performing a novel time  pressure experiment.

We find that DG giving is correlated with  cooperation in the repeated game when no cooperative equilibria exist,  but not when cooperation is an equilibrium. Furthermore, none of the  commonly observed strategies are better explained by inequity aversion  or efficiency concerns than money maximization. Various survey questions  provide additional evidence for the relative unimportance of social  preferences. We conclude that cooperation in repeated games is primarily  motivated by long-term payoff maximization and that even though some  subjects may have other goals, this does not seem to be the key  determinant of how play varies with the parameters of the repeated game.  In particular, altruism does not seem to be a major source of the  observed diversity of play.","349":"Two  separate bodies of work have examined whether culture affects  cooperation in economic games and whether cooperative or non-cooperative  decisions occur more quickly.

Almost the same is true in later rounds where neighbors  were previously cooperative (a cooperative environment) except decision  time among Indian subjects. However, when connecting neighbors were  previously not cooperative (a non-cooperative environment), a large  majority of both American and Indian subjects defect, and defection is  faster than cooperation among both sets of subjects.

In Study 1 (N\u00a0=\u00a0707), American participants who reported  living under higher quality cooperation-enforcing institutions (police  and courts) gave significantly more in a Dictator Game (DG), but did not  punish significantly more in a Third-Party Punishment Game (TPPG).

In Study 2 (N\u00a0=\u00a0516), we experimentally manipulated  institutional quality in a repeated Public Goods Game with a centralized  punishment institution. Consistent with the correlational results of  Study 1 and 1R, we found that centralized punishment led to  significantly more prosociality in a subsequent DG compared to a  no-punishment control, but had no significant direct effect on  subsequent TPPG punishment (only an indirect effect via increased DG  giving).

Additionally, as the number of decision sequences increases, there  is a pronounced decrease in cooperation in the final round of finite  sequences compared to those with a probabilistic end round.

We compare three  different experimental termination rules in four treatments: a known  finite end, an unknown end, and two variants with a random termination  rule (with a high and with a low continuation probability, where  cooperation can occur in a subgame-perfect equilibrium only with the  high probability). We find that the termination rules do not  significantly affect average cooperation rates. Specifically, employing a  random termination rule does not cause significantly more cooperation  compared to a known finite horizon, and the continuation probability  does not significantly affect average cooperation rates either. However,  the termination rules may influence cooperation over time and end-game  behavior. Further, the (expected) length of the game significantly  increases cooperation rates.

In weak-link coordination games players  choose a number 1\u20137. Their payoff is increasing in the minimum number  (or weakest link) and decreasing in the difference between their number  and the minimum. Choosing 7 is an efficient equilibrium because it gives  everybody a higher payoff than any other coordinated choice.  Higher-payoff equilibria are riskier, however, so the game expresses the  tradeoff between group efficiency and personal risk present in many  social and organizational settings. We tested whether choosing  efficiently in a weak-link game increases cooperative play in a  subsequent prisoner's dilemma (PD) game. This cross-game transfer  resembles the transfer of cooperative norms in small firms (which are  more like coordination games than PDs) as firms grow larger and become  like PDs. In two experiments, if a group of players share a history of  playing the weak-link game efficiently, that efficiency precedent can  transfer to a subsequent PD game, improving the level of  cooperativeness. The effect of transfer is much larger in magnitude  (increasing cooperation from 15\u201330% to 71%) than the effects of most  variables in previous PD studies. However, the transfer effect depends  on descriptive similarity of strategies in the two games, since it  largely disappears when the strategies are numbered differently in the  weak-link game and the PD.","358":"Two  experiments tested the effects of organizational identification on  individual decisions to cooperate.

We  also proposed that people would compete more if they see that others  have unexpectedly competed in a prior situation and cooperate more when  others have unexpectedly cooperated in a previous situation. Further, we  hypothesized that if others behave consistently with expectations, such  behaviors (either cooperative or competitive) would not affect  subsequent behavior.

Categorization level (Group vs.  Personal) and Type of Game (PDG vs. CDG vs. TDG) constituted the 2 \u00d7 3  factorial design. As predicted from Social Identity Theory, Group  Categorization elicited more cooperation than Personal Categorization.  Additional data sustained a social identification interpretation.  Second, it was investigated whether the rank order in cooperation among  the three games, which were presented to the subjects in a lifelike  format, would replicate the rank order observed in an abstract gaming  study, and it did: in the PDG fewer cooperative choices were made than  in the CDG, whereas in the CDG fewer cooperative choices were made than  in the TDG.","369":"The  present study presents a motivational theory of choice behavior in game  situations, and develops a method that provides a flexible means for  comparing the relative dominance of the various social motives  postulated to underlie choice behavior in such situations.

Study 1 found that members of  real groups were more cooperative than members of contrived groups and  that this effect was mediated by group identification. Study 2 showed  that participants were more cooperative when their in-group was in the  majority and that this effect was moderated by strength of group  identity. Study 3 replicated the mediation pattern found in Study 1  using different groups and a more rigorous method. In all three studies,  measures of group concern, group trust, normative expectations, concern  for personal benefit, estimated futility, and estimated redundancy were  also administered.

Groups with a high discount  rate used resource distribution strategies (coalition formation) that  resulted in lower individual as well as group outcomes.

Thus an understanding of  the factors influencing stakeholders\u2019 propensity to cooperate to achieve  shared benefits is essential to accomplishing successful collective  fisheries management. In this paper we study stakeholders\u2019 cooperative  behavioral disposition and elucidate the role of various socio-economic  factors in influencing it in the Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomon  Islands. We employed a Public Goods Game from experimental economics  tailored to mimic the problem of common pool fisheries management to  elucidate peoples\u2019 cooperative behavior. Using Ostrom's framework for  analyzing social-ecological systems to guide our analysis, we examined  how individual-scale variables (e.g., age, education, family size,  ethnicity, occupational status, personal norms), in the context of  village-scale variables (e.g., village, governance institutions, group  coercive action), influence cooperative behavior, as indexed by game  contribution. Ostrom's framework provides an effective window for  conceptually peeling back the various socio-economic and governance  layers which influence cooperation within these communities. The results  of our research show that the most important resource user  characteristics influencing cooperative behavior were age, occupation  and beliefs about giving access to others to fish for commercial gain.  Through elucidating the factors affecting stakeholders\u2019 propensity to  cooperate to achieve shared benefits, our analysis provides guidance in  understanding cooperation in relation to collective management of marine  resources.","373":"Recent  studies argue that cross-cultural variation in human cooperation  supports cultural group selection models of the evolution of large-scale  cooperation. However, these studies confound cultural and environmental  differences between populations by predominantly sampling one  population per society. Here, we test the hypothesis that behavioral  variation between populations is driven by environmental differences in  demography and ecology. We use a public goods game played with money and  a naturalistic measure of behavior involving the distribution of salt,  an essential and locally valued resource, to demonstrate significant  variation in levels of cooperation across 16 discrete populations of the  same small-scale society, the Pahari Korwa of central India. Variation  between these populations of the same cultural group is comparable to  that found between different cultural groups in previous studies.  Demographic factors partly explain this variation; age and a measure of  social network size are associated with contributions in the public  goods game, while population size and the number of adult sisters  residing in the population are associated with decisions regarding salt.  That behavioral variation is at least partly contingent on  environmental differences between populations questions the existence of  stable norms of cooperation. Hence, our findings call for  reinterpretation of cross-cultural data on cooperation. Although  cultural group selection could theoretically explain the evolution of  large-scale cooperation, our results make clear that existing  cross-cultural data cannot be taken as empirical support for this  hypothesis.","374":"During  the last decade, field experiments regarding the study of common pool  resource governance have been performed that replicated earlier findings  of laboratory experiments.

Context information is  derived from the communities via in-depth interviews, surveys and role  playing exercises. The use of different methodological tools allowed to  link decisions in field experiments with contextual variables for two  fishery villages. Explanation of core variables in social dilemmas is  given, the degree of cooperation levels, preferred rules, rule  compliance and enforcement. Main findings include: i) fishermen made  decisions in the field experiments that reflected their own experience  and context, ii) agreements for rule crafting are possible only under  specific conditions that guarantees livelihoods and sustainability, iii)  the broader context determines cooperation levels at a local level, iv)  inequalities in the sanctioning of rule breakers decrease the  possibilities of reaching cooperation agreements, and v) high levels of  trust among local fishermen is not a sufficient condition for resource  sustainability, when trust in external rule makers and enforcers is low.Research Highlights\u25ba  Combining field experiments, role games, surveys and interviews  contributes to asses the role of context in common resources users  behaviour. \u25ba Experiments shed light on what are the decisions, while  role games tell the why of those decisions. \u25ba Experimental results show  poor outcomes when rules where introduced, role games unveiled the  reasons for this behaviour. \u25ba Experimental results are indicators of  behavioural patterns outside the experimental arena as qualitative  insights instead of significant statistical results. \u25ba High resource  dependence (Colombia), and a competitive social setting (Thailand)are  the causes of a strong egoistic behaviour.","375":"nan","376":"This  quantitative review of 130 comparisons of interindividual and intergroup  interactions in the context of mixed-motive situations reveals that  intergroup interactions are generally more competitive than  interindividual interactions.

Results reveal that each moderator shares a unique association with the  magnitude of the discontinuity effect.

Three major factors that underlie the usual  discontinuity effect are reduced in the stochastic environment: greed,  fear, and persuasion power. Two group mechanisms are proposed to explain  the reversed discontinuity effect: the motivation to avoid guilt and  blame when making decisions that affect others\u2019 welfare, and the social  pressure to conform to certain norms when one is in a group setting.","378":"Previous  research has discovered a curious phenomenon: groups cooperate less  than individuals in a deterministic prisoner\u2019s dilemma game, but  cooperate more than individuals when uncertainty is introduced into the  game. We conducted two studies to examine three possible processes that  might drive groups to be more cooperative than individuals in reducing  risks: group risk concern, group cooperation expectation, and pressure  to conform to social norms. We found that ex post guilt aversion and  ex-post blame avoidance cause group members to be more risk concerned  than individuals under uncertainty. These concerns drive groups to  choose the cooperation (and risk-reduction) strategy more frequently  than individuals. Groups also have higher cooperation expectations for  their corresponding groups than individuals have for their corresponding  individuals.

It  has been argued that individuals will behave more cooperatively if they  know that their opponent has the option of using costly punishment. We  examined this hypothesis by conducting two repeated two-player  Prisoner's Dilemma experiments, that differed in their payoffs  associated to cooperation, with university students from Beijing as  participants. In these experiments, the level of cooperation either  stayed the same or actually decreased when compared with the control  experiments in which costly punishment was not an option.

In stage 1, players  simultaneously choose binding non-negative amounts to pay their  counterparts for cooperating in a given prisoner's dilemma game, and  then play the prisoner's dilemma game in stage 2 with knowledge of these  amounts.  For the asymmetric prisoner's dilemma games we consider, all  payment pairs consistent with mutual cooperation in subgame-perfect  equilibrium transform these prisoner's dilemma games into coordination  games, with both mutual cooperation and mutual defection as Nash  equilibria in the stage-2 game.  We find considerable empirical support  for the mechanism, as cooperation is much more common when these  endogenous transfer payments are feasible.  We identify patterns among  transfer pairs that affect the likelihood of cooperation.  Mutual  cooperation is most likely when the payments are identical; it is also  substantially more likely with payment pairs that bring the payoffs from  mutual cooperation closer together than with payment pairs that cause  them to diverge.  We also find that transfers are effective in  sustaining cooperation even when they are imposed and not chosen.  ","382":"Subtle  contextual social cues and the explicit incentive structure of social  dilemmas are two important, but fundamentally different classes of  determinants of cooperative behavior. The former provides subjective  social information regarding the likelihood of attaining mutual  cooperation by shaping one's expectations of the cooperative behavior of  the interacting party. The latter provides objective, ecological  information about the strategic opportunities offered by the situation.  In prior research, both classes have generally been studied in  isolation, hampering insight into how social judgments  and ecological opportunities interact in shaping cooperation. To fill  in this gap we set up a repeated mixed-motive game in which we  manipulate subtle social cues and the incentive structure of the game  simultaneously. We develop the hypothesis that social information is  less important in shaping mutual cooperation of two team members when  the incentive structure is such that it contains natural synergies.  In contrast, when the incentive structure offers no synergy, \u201crational  contracting\u201d is hampered and social cues are essential for mutual  cooperation to develop. The evidence we present in this paper is  consistent with this hypothesis.","383":"  Abstract  In this paper, we propose a measure of social capital based  on behaviour in a public goods game.

The level of  cooperation we observe in the \u2018treatment\u2019 community is considerably  higher than that in the \u2018control\u2019 community. The two neighbourhoods,  however, although similar in many dimensions, turn out to be  significantly different in other observable variables. The result we  obtain in terms of cooperation, however, is robust to controls for these  observable differences. We also compare our measure of social capital  with other more traditional measures that have been used in the  literature.   ","384":"Experimental  research has enhanced the knowledge acquired from theoretical and field  sources of when and how groups can solve the problem of collective  action through self-governing mechanisms. Widespread agreement exists  that cooperation can happen, but little agreement as to how. As a first  step, we propose that individuals may use three layers of information in  deciding about their level of cooperation. The layers range from the  material incentives of a specific production function and the dynamics  of the game, to the composition of the group and the individual  characteristics of the player. We use this framework to analyze data  from a set of experiments conducted with actual ecosystem users in three  rural villages of Colombia. Prior experience of the participants, their  perception of external regulation, and the composition of the group,  influence decisions to cooperate or defect in the experiment.  Understanding the multiple information levels of a game as they affect  incentives helps to explain decisions in collective-action dilemmas.","385":"Allowing  players in public goods games to make small incremental commitments to  contributing to the good might facilitate cooperation because it helps  to prevent players from being \u201cfree ridden,\u201d contributing more to the  public good than other group members.

Experiment 1 provided evidence that affording a  strategy of commitment can increase the production of public goods.  Experiment 2 provided evidence that most players are willing to  contribute to the public good at a level at or slightly above the  contribution of the lowest contributor in the group. Both experiments  point to inequity aversion as an important element of play in public  goods games.","386":"The  author examined a public goods (PG) dilemma with environmental  uncertainty in a sequential protocol of play paradigm.

Four experiments  were performed to explore this question. In Experiment 1 it was  demonstrated that group members correctly perceive that self-efficacy  declines with group size for step-level public goods problems. In  Experiments 2 and 3, group size was objectively unrelated to the  subjects' impact on the group's chances for obtaining a public good. But  in both experiments, subjects still felt more self-efficacious when the  group was smaller. A final experiment explored the relationship between  group size and perceived collective efficacy for obtaining a public  good. When the provision point was relatively low (viz., one-third of  the group had to contribute to provide the public good), subjects  generally perceived smaller groups to be more efficacious than larger  groups, even though under certain conditions precisely the opposite was  true. These illusions of efficacy were attributed to familiar judgmental  heuristics, involving an overgeneralization of experience in groups of  varying sizes. Their implications for cooperative behavior in social  dilemmas are discussed.","389":"The  authors have previously shown that intergroup interactions are  dramatically more competitive than interindividual interactions and have  termed this phenomenon a discontinuity effect. They believe that  this effect is partly driven by group members' fear of being exploited  by the out-group.

Intergroup competiteness may also  be driven by greed. Experiments 2 and 3 tested whether the group content  is propitious for providing social support for totally self-interested  acts. Trained role-players consistently suggested selecting either the  cooperative or the competitive option in a prisoner's dilemma game; and  groups received trial-by-trial feedback about the out-group's  responding.

The four experiments presented here addressed  when and why people volunteer in fictitious financial scenarios that  varied group size, the number of volunteers required, the payoffs to  volunteers and nonvolunteers, and the need to work more or for smaller  outcomes than others. The results suggest that, in general,  undergraduates, M.B.A.s, and executives volunteered most often when  personal benefits were high. Executives also focused on issues related  to self-interest when they were questioned about voluntary action in the  workplace.

To extend earlier research on environmental uncertainty in  resource dilemmas (i.e. uncertainty about the resource size), the  present experiment examines the effects of Environmental Uncertainty  (low, high uncertainty about the provision point) and Social Uncertainty  (low, high uncertainty about others' cooperation) in a public goods  dilemma. In line with Social Comparison Theory, it was predicted and  found that Environmental Uncertainty decreases cooperation only under  High Social Uncertainty, but not under Low Social Uncertainty. The  detrimental effects of Environmental Uncertainty can be counteracted by  uncertainty reducing information on the provision point and\/or on  others' contributions as well. \u00a9 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

In  Experiment 1, one group of 20 undergraduates guessed the size of the  resource as well as rated how confident they were. In three other groups  equal numbers of undergraduates requested an amount which they would  receive if it did not exceed the available resource. In one of these  groups the outcome was only dependent on resource size, whereas in the  remaining groups the outcome also depended on the requests by four other  unfamiliar subjects who were either real or imaginary. Partially  supporting a perceptual-bias explanation, subjects were in all groups  found to overestimate or overharvest when resource uncertainty  increased. Yet, an optimism or outcome-desirability bias explanation was  maintained since the requests increased more with resource uncertainty  than did the guesses whether or not the outcome depended on others'  requests. Experiment 2 employed another three groups of 20  undergraduates in a step-level resource-dilemma. Confirming the  conclusion of Experiment 1, the results supported the  outcome-desirability bias explanation but failed to support an  egoism-bias explanation in showing that the overharvesting effect of  resource uncertainty was not affected by social uncertainty.","393":"Common  to most theoretical and empirical research on public goods is the  assumption that the parameters of the game are common knowledge. Recent  theoretical and empirical studies have questioned this assumption by  arguing that many public goods situations are characterized by  uncertainty regarding various aspects of the situation. In particular,  Suleiman (1997) argued that members of production groups of step-level  public goods are often uncertain about the value of the provision  threshold. For this type of uncertainty he proposed three distinct  models to account for the individual's contribution.The present  study reports the results of an experiment designed primarily to test  and contrast the predictions derived from two of these models \u2013 a  subjective expected utility model and a cooperative model \u2013 regarding  the effects of threshold uncertainty on contribution for the provision  of step-level public goods. Other goals of the study were to test the  joint effect of the threshold uncertainty level, and its mean (low vs.  high), on contribution, and to examine the effect of threshold  uncertainty on the individuals' estimates regarding the contributions of  other group members.The results show that the effect of  threshold uncertainty is moderated by the threshold mean: Contribution  to the public good increased as a function of uncertainty for the lower  threshold mean, and decreased (though not significantly) for the higher  threshold mean. In contrast, for the two threshold means the subjects'  estimates of the mean and variability of others' contribution increased  with threshold uncertainty.The models' comparison revealed that the  cooperative model was superior to the subjective expected utility model.  This result adds to a substantial body of research on social dilemmas  showing that under conditions of social (strategic) uncertainty, group  members tacitly coordinate their choice behavior by anchoring their  decisions on rules of fairness.","394":"Many  interesting situations of public good provision such as a bystander's  decision to help a victim, a committee member's decision to veto, or a  company's decision to develop innovative products can be described by  the volunteer's dilemma (VOD).

The  game theoretic solution predicts that the probability of volunteering is  larger under the condition of sharing than when each volunteer pays the  full cost. It is predicted that, even when cost sharing, the individual  probability to volunteer decreases with group size, and larger groups  still underproduce the public good. Predictions are tested using data  collected via a mailed questionnaire to students of Berne University.  The quantitative predictions of the game-theoretic models do not  describe the data well, even when the models are extended with risk  preferences.

university          ","396":"This  study investigated the effect of group size uncertainty in a  single-stage step-level common pool resource dilemma under a sequential  (SEQ) and a Self-paced Sequential (SPS) protocol of play. In the  uncertain group size condition, participants were told that their group  was equally likely to be any size between three and seven persons. In  the certain group size condition, the group size was always five. In the  SEQ protocol, decisions were made in a pre-specified order such that  each player knew his or her position in the sequence, as well as the  combined requests of all the preceding players in the sequence. In the  SPS protocol, participants could choose when to make their decisions. In  both protocols, we replicated the position effects\u2014individual requests  are inversely related to the players' positions in the sequence with the  first mover requesting most, and the last mover requesting the least.  We also found that the position effect was stronger in SEQ than in SPS,  and when group size was certain than when it was not. Relative to group  size certainty, group size uncertainty decreased total requests and  increased provision rates.","397":"Considered in this paper is a noncooperative n-person  resource dilemma game in which players can share a common and uncertain  resource whose probability distribution is common knowledge. Making  their requests from the pool privately with no preplay communication,  individuals are granted their requests if, and only if, the total group  request does not exceed the value of the unknown resource. We  investigate this game under the sequential protocol of play and show  that if positions in the sequence are fixed for all stage games and  commonly known, the threat of retaliation against players requesting  disproportionally large shares is sufficient to induce a more  egalitarian distribution of requests. Acquisition of property rights,  which is hypothesized to induce more skewed request distributions, was  ineffective, presumably because of the relatively large group size, or  lack of outcome feedback.","398":"In  Experiment 1 we investigated size estimates and requests from an  uncertain resource in a common-pool resource dilemma. In Experiment 2,  we examined contributions in a public-good dilemma with an uncertain  provision threshold when participants were informed about others\u2019  pessimistically biased estimates of the resource size or provision  threshold. Supporting an individual outcome-desirability bias, but  refuting a perceptual bias and an egoism bias, participants in  Experiment 1 did not estimate size differently, and they cooperated  more, rather than less, when they were informed about others\u2019 estimates.  Likewise, participants contributed more in Experiment 2 when they were  informed about others\u2019 estimates. These results were replicated in  Experiment 3, where the outcome did not depend on others\u2019 requests or  contributions.","399":"This  study examined how order of contribution in a sequential public goods  dilemma affected cooperation. Under a sequential protocol of play,  players of different levels of efficacy made decisions one after  another. We contrasted a High-to-low versus Low-to-high Efficacy order  in a nine-person game. Under a High-to-low order, high-efficacy players  made decisions in positions 1\u20133, medium-efficacy players in positions  4\u20136, and low-efficacy players in positions 7\u20139. Under a Low-to-high  order, the positions of high- and low-efficacy players were reversed. We  hypothesized that cooperation rates would be higher in the High-to-low  order that high-efficacy players (assigned in early positions), who  would likely cooperate, would induce subsequent players to cooperate  also. We found the anticipated effect that cooperation rate was higher  in the High-to-low than the Low-to-high efficacy order. The efficacy  order effect was the most prominent when people perceived that their  group was becoming uncooperative. This study illustrates a new type of  structural solution to social dilemmas that by systematically assigning  people to different sequential positions, a group can be made more or  less cooperative.","400":"Face-to-face  discussion has been shown to increase cooperative behavior in social  dilemmas. Two general explanations of this effect were tested: group  identity (concern for fellow group members' outcomes) and perception of  consensus (degree of agreement perceived among group members on how to  respond to the dilemma). Undergraduate students participated in four  person groups in one of four experimental conditions. The four  conditions differed in common fate (interdependent outcome in a  lottery), face-to-face discussion of the dilemma, discussion of an  important (irrelevant) issue, and no discussion (control). Results  indicate that (a) the common fate manipulation neither aroused group  identity nor enhanced cooperation, (b) group identity may not be  sufficient to elicit cooperation in a social dilemma, and (c) the most  plausible explanation of group discussion effects is members' perceived  consensus to cooperate.","401":"Three  different types of N-person social dilemma games were employed: the  Prisoner's Dilemma (NPD), the Chicken Dilemma (NCD), and the Trust  Dilemma (NTD). Subjects, who were classified a priori as either a  cooperator (n = 58) or a defector (n = 68), participated in one of the  social dilemma games before they received bogus feedback: they were told  that the majority had chosen the defecting alternative D, or that the  majority had chosen the cooperative alternative C. As predicted, (1)  both before and after feedback, more defecting choices were made in the  NPD than in the NCD, whereas in the NCD more defecting choices were made  than in the NTD; (2) before and after feedback, defectors made more  defecting choices than cooperators; (3) after majority D feedback more  defecting choices were made than after majority C feedback. In addition,  it appeared that in NPD and in NTD, defectors were especially sensitive  to majority D feedback in that it facilitated their natural inclination  to prefer D-choices. No support for Kelley and Stahelski's triangle  hypothesis was observed.","402":"Groups  of six undergraduates were given a resource management task in which  they were to harvest points from a regenerating resource pool. Their  objective was to maximize individual harvests while maintaining the  common resource pool. Following the trials, subjects were asked to vote  on how to conduct a second session. The 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 between-subjects  factorial design crossed two levels of resource use (overuse, optimal  use) with two levels of variance of others' purported harvests (low,  high) and three levels of type of alternative to free access (leader,  equal division, proportional division). As predicted, overuse subjects  voted to give up free access to the resource and change the decision  structure more frequently than subjects in the optimal use condition.  Electing a group leader was the most popular structural solution,  followed by proportional division of the resource pool, with equal  division being the least acceptable change. As expected, high variance  among group members' harvests was found to increase subjects'  preferences for structural change in the leader and equal division  conditions, while decreasing preferences for change in the proportional  division conditions.","403":"nan","404":"In  the last decade, there has been a resurgence of interest in problems of  cooperation, stimulated largely by Axelrod's work. Using an innovative  tournament approach, Axelrod found that a simple strategy, tit-for-tat  (TFT), was most successful in playing the repeated prisoner's dilemma  (PD) in a noiseless environment. However, recent analytical work has  shown that monitoring problems caused by noise significantly impair  TFT's effectiveness. The primary purpose of the present research is to  discover whether there exist alternative strategies that perform well in  noisy PDs. To investigate this question, the authors conducted a  computer tournament. The results of the tournament demonstrated that,  consistent with analytical work, TFT performed rather poorly. In  contrast, strategies that were generous (i.e., cooperated more than  their partners did) were quite effective.","405":"This  study examined how low- and high-trust individuals react to messages of  intended behavior in a social dilemma situation. Subjects played a  two-person prisoner's dilemma; the opponent was a reciprocal strategy  programmed by the experimenter. During the game, subjects received a  message stating that the opponent planned to be cooperative or  competitive for the remainder of the game. In Study 1, low trusters  reacted to the competitive message by decreasing cooperation but were  unaffected by the cooperative message; high trusters reacted to the  cooperative message by increasing cooperation but were unaffected by the  competitive message. Study 2 showed that a period of unconditional,  message-consistent behavior immediately after the message can make low  and high trusters responsive to cooperative and competitive messages,  respectively.

In the first experiment the experimenter's strategies for different  groups of subjects were: (a) play tit\u2010for\u2010tat; (b) play randomly; (c)  always cooperate; (d) always defect (\u2018cooperation\u2019 and \u2018defection\u2019,  defined as in an actual prisoner's dilemma game). Only the tit\u2010for\u2010tat  group increased cooperation over trials; other groups decreased  cooperation. After playing the PPD with the experimenter, subjects  played an actual prisoner's dilemma (PD) game with each other. In the PD  game, subjects began cooperating moderately but cooperation  deteriorated regardless of what the experimenter's strategy had been in  the earlier (PPD) game. In a second experiment, subjects again played a  PPD game with the experimenter and then played a PD game with each  other. Half played one trial at a time as in the first experiment while  half played in patterns of four trials at a time. In the PD game,  patterning of trials retarded the development of mutual defection  regardless of previous experience.

Two important properties of the TFT strategy are based on the  reciprocity norm: (1) It is \u201cprovocable\u201d and immediately retaliates if  the other person defects; and (2) it is \u201cforgiving\u201d and immedicately  reciprocates cooperation if the other returns to cooperation after  defection. Delay of reciprocity for the two types of TFT properties were  varied: immediate versus one trial delay. In two experiments, a single  naive subject (undergraduate male student) was led to believe that he  was playing a two-person prisoner's dilemma, but he actually played  against a programmed strategy. The results of both experiments yielded  significant effects for delay of forgiveness: Mean proportion of  cooperative choices was greater when cooperative overtures were  reciprocated immediately than when they were delayed. Two other  properties of TFT, \u201cniceness\u201d and clarity, were also assessed.

In this research, a  repeated measures design was used to assess the nature and long-term  persistence of such training. One month after playing against a  programmed tit-for-tat strategy, participants returned to the lab to  play a randomly matched other participant. Participants increased their  levels of cooperative behavior, both during the 1st sequence and in the  2nd sequence compared with the first. Dispositional competitors  increased the most from the 1st to the 2nd sequence and also gained the  most new respect for opponents' self-interestedness following the 1st  sequence. This suggests that competitors may be individualists at heart  and that the \"punitive\" feature of tit-for-tat (R.

We also found that scores on some of the  personality dimensions we investigated (self\u2010monitoring, self\u2010esteem,  neuroticism, and conscientiousness) correlated with player type.

In examining  variables other than the payoff matrices, two lines of research have  emerged: studying personality variables as they affect play and  examining the effects of various situational variables such as seating  arrangement or availability of communication. The present study contends  that since the manipulation of situational variables in effect alters  the information each S  has about the game, the other player or  both, then a relevant organismic variable might well be the information  processing characteristics of the players. To examine this possibility  36 pairs of male S s played a 60\u2010trial iterative PD in one of two conditions: face\u2010to\u2010face; or in separate rooms. Half of the S s were abstract information processors (AIP), and half were concrete (CIP). S   pairs were formed on the basis of the level of information processing  complexity (LIP) of the members. These pairs were then assigned to one  of three conditions which were based upon the LIP of the S s. The  resultant groups were: AIP\u2010AIP, AIP\u2010CIP, and CIP\u2010CIP. It was predicted  that LIP and information available about the other S  would be  nonindependent with respect to cooperation, defections, and money won.  The results supported the hypothesis for cooperation and defection, but  not for the money won. An examination of the interaction of the  independent variables suggested that AIPs and CIPs approach this task  differently, and develop their strategies from different types of  information.

The correlation between the number of collaborative responses and the  amount of money for which the game was being played was insignificant.  These results support those of Scodel, et al.

We build an agent-based model to explore whether networks that do not  rely on geographic proximity can support cooperation as well as local  interactions can. Adaptive agents play a four-move Prisoner's Dilemma  game, where an agent's strategy specifies the probability of cooperating  on the first move, and the probability of cooperating contingent on the  partner's previous choice. After playing with four others, an agent  adjusts its strategy so that more successful strategies are better  represented in the succeeding round. The surprising result is that if  the pattern of interactions is selected at random, but is persistent  over time, cooperation emerges just as strongly as it does when  interactions are geographically local. This has implications for both  research on social dynamics, and for the prospects for building social  capital in the modern age.","431":"We  analyze the role of social structure in maintaining cooperation within a  population of adaptive agents for whom cooperative behavior may be  costly in the short run. We use the example of a collection of agents  playing pairwise Prisoner's Dilemma. We call sustained cooperative  behavior in such circumstances a `cooperative regime'. We show that  social structure, by channeling which agents interact with which others,  can sustain cooperative regimes against forces that frequently dissolve  them. We show in detail the process through which structured  interaction in a population creates a `shadow of the adaptive  future', allowing even a small set of cooperative strategies to grow  into a cooperative regime, a coherent, self-sustaining entity that is  something more than the sum of the pairwise interactions among its  members.","432":"This  article describes computer simulations in which pairs of \"individuals\"  in large groups played a prisoners' dilemma game.

Wins  and losses were determined through the comparison of a play's outcome  with the average outcome of the individual's neighbors. The results  revealed qualitative differences between small and large groups.  Furthermore, the prevalence of cooperation in the population depended in  predictable ways on the heuristic used, the values of the payoff  matrix, and the details of the social comparison process that framed the  outcomes as wins or losses.

When future interaction partners  can choose with whom they wish to interact, this could lead to  competition to be more generous than others. Little empirical work has  tested for the possible existence of this \u2018competitive altruism\u2019. Using a  cooperative monetary game with and without opportunities for partner  choice and signalling cooperative intent, we show here that people  actively compete to be more generous than others when they can benefit  from being chosen for cooperative partnerships, and the most generous  people are correspondingly chosen more often as cooperative partners. We  also found evidence for increased scepticism of altruistic signals when  the potential reputational benefits for dishonest signalling were high.

We tested whether  this strategy was adopted by subjects participating in an experiment in  which they could choose how much money to give to a partner, reciprocity  being encouraged by doubling donations. Subjects did increase their  donations over successive rounds, both when playing against a stooge who  reciprocated with the same investment, and when playing with a partner  who was free to choose their investment. Subjects showed a strong  tendency to match variations in their partner's investments. Cooperation  was therefore achieved through a combination of initial escalation (RTS  strategy) and quantitative responsiveness (\u2018give\u2013as\u2013good\u2013as\u2013you\u2013get\u2019  strategy).

In two conditions the subjects played a standard  two\u2010choice prisoner's Dilemma game (200 trials); in two conditions the  subjects played the standard game modified to include a prediction of  Other's behavior on each trial. In each of the above situations,  subjects in one condition were told that they were faced with a preset  sequence while subjects in the other condition thought they were playing  with one of the other subjects present in the experiment. In a fifth  condition the feedback was not given any meaning as part of the game  task; subjects merely had to predict the appearance of one of two lights  on each of the 200 trials. The 100 subjects were assigned randomly to  conditions with ten males and ten females in each condition. Analysis of  the frequency of cooperative choice in the game indicates that the  addition of prediction to the game had no significant main effect on  choice behavior. There was a three\u2010factor interaction effect with the  description of the feedback and the trial block of the game. Subjects  tended to decrease cooperation over trial blocks. The act of prediction  reduced this effect for subjects who thought they faced a preset  computer sequence but not for those attempting to predict the moves of a  human adversary. The use of prediction data in combination with choice  data produced four indices of behavior contingent upon expectation of  opponent's behavior. These indices were useful in interpreting the  higher cooperation of the females as an inability to find or maintain  optimal strategies for maximizing their own rewards. An examination of  the prediction data alone revealed that a probability matching  hypothesis by itself will be inadequate to explain subjects' trial by  trial expectations of Other's behavior.

In social cooperation situations a single person's  cooperative act, if not reciprocated by others, would be unreinforced  both immediately and in the long term. Similarly, a single act of  self\u2010control (refusing a single cigarette, for example), if not followed  up by other such acts, would also be unreinforced immediately and in  the long term. The present experiments varied probability of  reciprocation in a prisoner's dilemma\u2010like game that could resemble a  social cooperation or a self\u2010control situation. Participants earned  points by playing against a computer. The computer offered the  participant a choice between 5 or 6 points (\u2018cooperation\u2019 by the  computer) or between 1 or 2 points (\u2018defection\u2019 by the computer). The  participant's choice of the lesser alternative (\u2018cooperation\u2019) or the  greater alternative (\u2018defection\u2019) on the current trial led,  respectively, to cooperation or defection by the computer on the next  trial with a probability (probability of reciprocation, PR) which could  vary. When PR was greater than 63%, consistent cooperation maximized the  participant's earnings. When PR was less than 63%, defection maximized  earnings. Three conditions were studied: PR signaled by spinners; PR  unsignaled; PR unsignaled with participants believing that they were  playing with another person, not the computer. With PR = 100%  (\u2018tit\u2010for\u2010tat\u2019) and PR = 50%, the modal participant maximized earnings  under all three conditions. With PR = 75%, participants maximized  earnings only when PR was signaled. These results indicate that  differences between people's tendency to cooperate with other people  (social cooperation) and their tendency to cooperate with their own  future interests (self\u2010control) may lie in differences in subjective PR.

In Experiment 1, pairs of starlings housed in  adjacent cages played a discrete\u2010trial \u201cgame\u201d in which food could be  obtained only by \u201ccooperation.\u201d In this game, pecking at a response key  eliminated the opportunity to obtain food but produced food for the  partner. If neither bird pecked, neither had the opportunity to obtain  food in that trial. Some level of cooperation persisted for several  sessions whether the birds had been pretrained for a high or low  probability of pecking at the key. The probability of a cooperative  response was higher after trials in which the partner responded (and a  reward was obtained) than after trials in which neither bird responded  (and no reward was obtained), but the probability of a response was even  higher after trials in which the same bird had responded, even though  no reward was obtained by the actor in these trials. This behavior did  not require visual presence of another player, because similar results  were obtained in Experiment 2 (a replicate of Experiment 1 in which the  members of the pair could not see each other) and in Experiment 3, a  game in which each starling played with a computer responding with \u201ctit  for tat.\u201d Using an omission schedule, in which food was given in all  trials in which the bird did not peck, Experiment 4 showed that pecking  could be maintained by autoshaping. In this experiment, overall  probability of pecking decreased with experience, due to a drop in the  tendency to peck in consecutive trials. The probability of pecking in  trials following a reinforced trial did not decrease with experience.

We design a three-stage repayment game to examine how  the existence of these ancillary activities affect repayment behavior  and group attrition. In the first stage, the group borrows under joint  liability, each member undertakes a risky project and decides whether or  not to contribute to loan repayment. In the second stage, contributing  members can vote to expel others from the group. Those remaining engage  in a public goods game in the last stage. The public good game  represents the non-credit collective activity that members can be  involved in. We identify repayment equilibria with and without exclusion  and show that exclusionary equilibria are most likely when loans are  large and there is significant within-group heterogeneity in the gains  from the public good. Results from a laboratory experiment that embodies  the main features of the repayment game are consistent with the  theoretical predictions. Individual decisions to contribute to loan  repayment depend on gains from the public good and groups with the  largest debt burdens have the highest rates of default and attrition.","447":" The public goods game is the classic laboratory paradigm for  studying collective action problems. Each participant chooses how much  to contribute to a common pool that returns benefits to all participants  equally. The ideal outcome occurs if everybody contributes the maximum  amount, but the self-interested strategy is not to contribute anything.  Most previous studies have found punishment to be more effective than  reward for maintaining cooperation in public goods games. The typical  design of these studies, however, represses future consequences for  today\u2019s actions. In an experimental setting, we compare public goods  games followed by punishment, reward, or both in the setting of truly  repeated games, in which player identities persist from round to round.  We show that reward is as effective as punishment for maintaining public  cooperation and leads to higher total earnings. Moreover, when both  options are available, reward leads to increased contributions and  payoff, whereas punishment has no effect on contributions and leads to  lower payoff. We conclude that reward outperforms punishment in repeated  public goods games and that human cooperation in such repeated settings  is best supported by positive interactions with others.

Using a large sample of experimental data, we empirically  recover the set of norms used most often by monitors and show first  that the decision to punish should be modeled separately from the  decision of how much to punish. Second, we show that absolute norms  often fit the data better than the group average norm often assumed in  related work.

This module enables humans, to a certain extent, to predict how willing  another might be to cooperate or not. Using unknown target subjects who  had played a one-shot prisoner's dilemma game earlier, we asked  participants in two experiments to rate how cooperative these target  subjects were. Pictures were taken of the target subjects at three  different moments: a neutral-expression picture taken prior to the game,  an event-related picture taken during the decision-making moment of a  practice round, and an event-related picture taken during the  decision-making moment of a proper round. We found that participants in  the experiments could accurately discriminate noncooperative pictures  from cooperative ones, but only in response to those taken during the  proper round. In both neutral-expression pictures and practice-round  pictures, identification rates did not exceed chance level. These  findings leave room for the existence of a predictive cheater detection  module that deduces someone's decision to cooperate from event-related facial expressions.","451":"Previous  research has suggested that the spontaneous display of positive emotion  may be a reliable signal of cooperative tendency in humans. Consistent  with this proposition, several studies have found that self-reported  cooperators indeed display higher levels of positive emotions than  non-cooperators. In this study, we defined cooperators and  non-cooperators in terms of their behavior as the proposer in an ultimatum game, and video-taped their facial expressions  as they faced unfair offers as a responder. A detailed analysis of the  facial expressions displayed by participants revealed that cooperators  displayed greater amounts of emotional expressions, not limited to  positive emotional expression, when responding to unfair offers in the  ultimatum game. These results suggest that cooperators may be more  emotionally expressive than non-cooperators. We speculate that emotional  expressivity can be a more reliable signal of cooperativeness than the  display of positive emotion alone.","452":"Cosmides  and Tooby argue that humans possess a domain-specific cheater detection  module, which allows them to keep track of who has honored and who has  violated social contracts.

We show, in Experiments 1\u20133, that humans  better recognize faces of cheaters than those of cooperators when they  do not know who are cheaters and cooperators. Experiment 4 demonstrates,  however, that humans think they recognize cheaters' faces even when  they have not seen them before. The results of these experiments suggest  that cheaters might look different from cooperators, possibly due to  beliefs and personality traits  that make them less ideal exchange partners, and the human mind might  be capable of picking up on subtle visual cues that cheaters' faces give  off.","453":"Evolution-inspired  research assumes the existence of brain mechanisms that scan for  information that might signal noncooperative behavior.

We adapt the social dilemma research paradigm to  quantitatively analyze different modes of communication. Using this  method, we compare four forms of communication: no communication,  text-chat, text-to-speech, and voice. We found statistically significant  differences between different forms of communication, with the voice  condition resulting in the highest levels of cooperation. Our results  highlight the importance of striving towards the use of more immediate  forms of communication in online environments, especially where trust  and cooperation are essential.

We  examine the robustness of communication as an efficiency-enhancing  mechanism in settings where appropriators differ in input endowments.  This heterogeneity creates a distributional conflict over access to  common-pool resources. This conflict can cause self-governance to fail.  We present findings from a series of experiments where heterogeneous  endowments are assigned: (1) randomly, and appropriators have complete  information, (2) through an auction, and appropriators have complete  information, and (3) randomly, and appropriators have incomplete and  asymmetric information.

Consistent with hypotheses, Study 1 revealed that  negative noise exerts detrimental effects on both impressions of  partners' benign intent and cooperation and that these detrimental  effects could be effectively reduced by communication about noise. Study  2 replicated both findings but only for individuals with low trust.

We developed the \u201cRemoving The Sanction\u201d  paradigm and a new trust manipulation, and showed in three experiments  that when there is a sanction on defection, trust in others being  internally motivated to cooperate is undermined: Participants who had  experienced the presence of a sanctioning system trusted fellow group  members less than participants who had not. In a similar vein, the  sanction undermined cooperation when trust was initially high. The  implications of these paradoxical findings are discussed.","481":"In  this paper, we report an experimental investigation of the effect of  framing on social preferences, as revealed in a one-shot linear public  goods game.

Our findings are that, for a given pattern of  contributions, neither type of indicator depends on the Give versus Take  framing that we manipulate. To this extent, they suggest that the  social preferences we observe are robust to framing effects.","482":"Low  and high consistent pro-socials and pro-selfs were primed with neutral,  morality, or might concepts in mixed-motive situations.

The authors also expected the primes to influence cooperative behavior  more among low than high consistent individuals. Four experiments using  supraliminal (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) or subliminal (Experiment 3)  priming and 2-person (Experiments 1-3) or N-person (Experiment  4) social dilemmas partially supported these initial predictions.

Moreover, social  scientists have found overwhelming evidence that such cooperative  behavior is likely to be directed toward in-group members. We propose  that the group-based nature of cooperation includes punishment behavior.  Punishment behavior is used to maintain cooperation within systems of  social exchange and, thus, is directed towards members of an exchange  system. Because social exchanges often take place within groups, we  predict that punishment behavior is used to maintain cooperation in the  punisher's group. Specifically, punishment behavior is directed toward  in-group members who are found to be noncooperators. To examine this, we  conducted a gift-giving game experiment with third-party punishment.  The results of the experiment (N=90) support the following  hypothesis: Participants who are cooperative in a gift-giving game  punish noncooperative in-group members more severely than they punish  noncooperative out-group members.","484":"Cooperation  among nonrelatives can be puzzling because cooperation often involves  incurring costs to confer benefits on unrelated others. Punishment of  noncooperators can sustain otherwise fragile cooperation, but the  provision of punishment suffers from a \"second-order\" free-riding  problem because nonpunishers can free ride on the benefits from costly  punishment provided by others. One suggested solution to this problem is  second-order punishment of nonpunishers; more generally, the threat or  promise of higher order sanctions might maintain the lower order  sanctions that enforce cooperation in collective action problems. Here  the authors report on 3 experiments testing people's willingness to  provide second-order sanctions by having participants play a cooperative  game with opportunities to punish and reward each other. The authors  found that people supported those who rewarded cooperators either by  rewarding them or by punishing nonrewarders, but people did not support  those who punished noncooperators--they did not reward punishers or  punish nonpunishers. Furthermore, people did not approve of punishers  more than they did nonpunishers, even when nonpunishers were clearly  unwilling to use sanctions to support cooperation. The results suggest  that people will much more readily support positive sanctions than they  will support negative sanctions.

Previous research has shown that trust and  contributions are positively related such that high trusters generally  contribute more than low trusters. The present research questions the  pervasiveness of this relation by arguing that low trusters may increase  their contributions to the same level as those of high trusters, but  only under circumstances where their decisions are highly identifiable  to their interaction partner(s). Both studies showed that strong  perceptions of trust, high accountability and high self\u2010monitoring  influenced contributions positively. In line with predictions,  individuals low in trust contributed up to the same level as high  trusters when accountability was high rather than low. Moreover, this  interaction between trust and accountability was only found among those  classified as high self\u2010monitors.

In the experimental work presented here, a  shared-database setting is selected as a prototypical situation of  net-based information exchange and examined from a social-dilemma  perspective: the individual who contributes information to a shared  database must reckon with costs and no benefits. The most efficient  strategy from the perspective of the individual is thus to withhold  information. Previous research has shown that a group-awareness tool  which provides information about the contribution behavior of group  members influences people's information-exchange behavior. In order to  examine the psychological processes underlying these effects of group  awareness in more detail, the present study adopts an interactional approach,  according to which person-situation interaction is investigated.  Certain personality traits (interpersonal trust, sensation seeking, and  self-monitoring) were measured and several hypotheses tested regarding  the reactions of individuals with high and low trait values to different  types of awareness information. Results demonstrate that awareness  tools providing information about highly cooperative group members  encourage participants to trust one another and minimize the risk of  being exploited. When an awareness tool additionally provides feedback  about the contribution behavior of single individuals, it becomes an  opportunity for self-presentation. In conclusion, an interactional approach which considers personality traits and situational factors  in a net-based information-exchange situation provides new insights  into both the influence processes of group awareness and the connection  of these processes to specific personality traits with respect to  contribution behavior.","491":"Research  suggests that contribution to public goods (i.e. cooperation) will  increase when groups use sanctions. We argue that when groups use  rewards and punishments to induce members to cooperate in a social  dilemma, individuals' natural propensity to cooperate may be reduced.  Results from two laboratory experiments provide consistent support for  our hypothesis. Specifically, we found that cooperation (in groups that  adopted sanctioning systems, including both reward and punishment)  decreased significantly following the removal of sanctioning systems. We  also found that a moral appeal to cooperate was as effective as  sanctions in inducing cooperation. Moreover, cooperation induced through  appeals was more likely to sustain than that induced through sanctions.  We found that people's trust in others' cooperation mediated the  relationship between the use of sanctions and appeals and the level of  cooperation after these inducing practices were removed.

Conversely,  trust is very important to enhance cooperative behavior of participants  with a prosocial value orientation, whereas explicit incentives are less  important compared to proselfs.

When such expectations were experimentally  eliminated, women did not show any in-group bias, whereas men still  exhibited an in-group bias. This male-specific in-group bias was found  to be a product of intragroup cooperation (in-group love) rather than a  product of intergroup competition (out-group hate).

University students from Japan,  China, and Taiwan participated in experiments involving participants  from their own society and another society in real time using an  intercultural trust paradigm derived from a game theoretic and  evolutionary approach to social exchange. The modified trust game  improves on the Prisoner's Dilemma Game by eliminating greed as an  explanation for lack of cooperation: the truster unilaterally decides  whether or not to trust their exchange partner, and the allocator then  decides whether or not to divide the reward fairly between the two of  them. Participants earned real money by playing six rounds of one-shot  trust games with three in-group members and three out-group members over  the Internet. Across three experiments involving two interacting  societies each, Japanese were found to be less trusting and trustworthy  exchange partners compared to cultural Chinese. This suggests that  Japanese collectivism is based more on long-term assurance networks,  whereas Chinese collectivism provides a more expansive, guanxi-based  approach to building new social networks.

Results support the hypothesis:  when fear was present, high trusters cooperated more frequently than low  trusters; when absent, high and low trusters cooperated at the same  rate. The findings held across both games. However, the effects of fear  within each game were not straightforward: removing fear from the  resource dilemma increased low trusters' cooperation rates, but removing  fear from the public goods game decreased high trusters' cooperation  rates.

Moreover, the results indicate that this was especially the  case when people did not expect fellow group members to cooperate.

Competition in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma game was greater  when opportunities for altruistic rationalization were present, but this  effect was significant only for participants who were low in  dispositional proneness to guilt, a trait that motivates prosocial  behavior.

Two studies are presented which show that  group members low in dispositional trust (low trusters) are likely to  choose for a public commitment system when their situational  expectations concerning other group members' contributions are high,  while those high in dispositional trust (high trusters) are likely to  choose for a public commitment system when their situational  expectations concerning other group members' contributions are low. It  appears that for both low and high trusters the choice for a system of  public commitments is instigated by a motivation to further the  collective outcomes.","516":"On  the basis of prior research, group failure on a task was expected to  adversely affect cooperative responses to a subsequent social dilemma.  However, from social identity theory, it was predicted that this effect  would be moderated by strength of group identity.

First, we predicted and found that across social values the  degree of co\u2010operative behaviour increased as a linear function of the  extent to which the other was seen as moral. Concerning the perceptions  in terms of potency, we found a significant quadratic trend; another  seen as moderate on potency elicited more co\u2010operative behaviour than  another seen as either high or low on potency. These effects of person  perception were not moderated by social value. More interesting was the  finding that even though persons classified as pro\u2010social (co\u2010operators  and altruists) and pro\u2010self (individualists and competitors) held about  the same expectation about the magnitude of another's co\u2010operation,  pro\u2010socials behaved more co\u2010operatively than pro\u2010selfs.

As predicted on the basis of the Might over  Morality hypothesis (Liebrand, Jansen et al., 1986), it was found that  considerably more cooperation was expected from one perceived as highly  moral than from another perceived as low on morality. Contrary to a  second Might over Morality prediction, however, this effect was not  moderated by individual differences in social value orientation. In  addition, it was found that subjects with pro\u2010social value orientations,  as well as those with individualistic and competitive orientations  cooperated considerably more with a person perceived as highly moral  than with another perceived as low on morality. This latter finding  extends previous work on social value orientation in that it suggests  that individuals who are predisposed to choose noncooperatively in  social dilemmas are willing to cooperate if they are quite confident  that the other has truly cooperative and good intentions.

Support for the  triangle hypothesis came from data gathered in a situation similar to  that employed by Kelley and Stahelski. In this situation, Ss who adopted  a competitive orientation tended to (a) expect more homogeneity in the  orientations of their opponents than did Ss with a cooperative  orientation and (b) dominate behaviorally Ss with a cooperative  orientation. Neither of these effects were found in a situation which  provided Ss with a more flexible behavioral repertoire. The importance  of the impact of structural factors on conflict processes was further  shown by an examination of the self-fulfilling prophecy effects found in  the 2 situations. Preinteraction expectations had a pronounced effect  on both the course of the interaction and opponent evaluations in the  1st situation, while only weak effects of preinteraction expectations  were found in the 2nd, less restrictive, situation.

Prior theorizing  suggests that cross-societal differences in trust play a key role in  determining the effectiveness of punishment, as a form of social norm  enforcement, to promote cooperation. One line of reasoning is that  punishment promotes cooperation in low-trust societies, primarily  because people in such societies expect their fellow members to  contribute only if there are strong incentives to do so. Yet another  line of reasoning is that high trust makes punishment work, presumably  because in high-trust societies people may count on each other to make  contributions to public goods and also enforce norm violations by  punishing free riders. This poses a puzzle of punishment: Is punishment  more effective in promoting cooperation in high- or low-trust societies?  In the present article, we examine this puzzle of punishment in a  quantitative review of 83 studies involving 7,361 participants across 18  societies that examine the impact of punishment on cooperation in a  public goods dilemma. The findings provide a clear answer: Punishment  more strongly promotes cooperation in societies with high trust rather  than low trust.","532":"Because  costly punishment is not credible, subgame perfection suggests that  punishment will not deter free riding, regardless of the size or  structure of groups.

We test  these hypotheses experimentally and examine whether the effect of group  size is purely due to the number of group members or if information  about other group members is what is important. We find that large  groups contribute at rates no lower than small groups because punishment  does not fall appreciably in large groups. However, hindrances to  monitoring do reduce the provision of the public good.","533":"  Abstract   Researchers have found that voting can help increase  voluntary contributions to a public good\u2014provided enforcement through a  third party.

All three studies  show that giving to the group mattered because it signaled an  individual's motivation to help the group.

OT enhanced cooperation  only when social information was present, and this effect was  significantly more pronounced in the Coordination Game. When social  information was lacking, OT surprisingly decreased cooperation.  Consistent with the well-established role of OT in trust-building and in  social cognition,  social information appears to be crucial for OT to boost cooperative  expectations in an interdependent social interaction that provides  incentives to cooperate.

Moreover, female players in the IPD applied Tit-for-Tat-like or  Pavlovian strategies significantly more often than male players, thereby  achieving significantly higher pay-offs than male players did. These  data demonstrate that the willingness to cooperate does not only depend  on the type of the social dilemma, but also on the class of individuals  involved. Altogether, our study shows that the ISD can potentially  explain high levels of cooperation among non-relatives in humans. In  addition, the ISD seems to reflect the social dilemma more realistically  than the IPD because individuals obtain immediate direct benefits from  the cooperative acts they perform and costs of cooperation are shared  between cooperators.","548":"We  study experimentally how males and females differ in the way  same-gender peers observing their action affects their social behavior.  In our experiment, people play a Prisoner\u02bcs Dilemma game with a partisan  audience watching the choice. Two groups participated in each session;  these groups could be both all-male, both all-female, or one all-male  and one all-female. Groups were separated into two rooms. Each person in  the group played the game once with an audience of the same group and  once with audience of the other group. Behavior is significantly  affected by the interaction of gender and place: males cooperate  substantially less often when observed by their peer group, while  females cooperate substantially more often. We discuss a possible  explanation for this pattern: Males and females wish to signal their  in-group peers, but males wish to signal their formidability and females  wish to signal their cooperativeness.","549":"  Abstract  Two studies examined the effect of Extrinsic Value  Orientation (Kasser &amp; Ryan, 1993, 1996) upon harvesting strategies  and personal profit within commons dilemmas, in which individual and  group interests can be at odds. At an individual or within\u2010group level  of analysis, extrinsically oriented persons (who value money, fame, and  popularity) harvested more than intrinsically oriented persons (who  value self\u2010acceptance, intimacy, and community). However, a  counteracting group\u2010level effect was found such that groups with a  greater number of extrinsic members harvested less on average than did  groups with more intrinsic members, because their commons did not last  as long. As a result, even excessive harvesters within extrinsic groups  did no better than did self\u2010restrained harvesters within intrinsic  groups. Supplementary analyses indicate that extrinsic values are  associated with acquisitiveness  regarding resources, more so than apprehension  regarding others' acquisitiveness.

We attribute the latter result  to the very similar reactions of men and women to experiences they have  made in previous rounds.

In the first experiment (n  = 78), PD players who had a chance, before they played the game, to  think both about the nature of the game they were playing and about  their partner's choice were less cooperative compared to players of the  standard one-shot PDG. In the second experiment (n = 105), PD  players were again less cooperative when they made their decision before  they were matched with a particular partner than after they had been  matched with a partner. Results strongly suggest the operation of a SEH.","552":" Abstract Why  do people frequently cooperate in defiance of their immediate  incentives? One explanation is that individuals are conditionally  cooperative. As an explanation of behavior in one-shot settings, such  preferences require individuals to be able to discern their opponents'  preferences. Using data from a television game show, we provide evidence  about how individuals implement conditionally cooperative preferences.  We show that contestants forgo large sums of money to be cooperative;  they cooperate at heightened levels when their opponents are predictably  cooperative; and they fare worse when their observable characteristics  predict less cooperation because opponents avoid cooperating with them.

However, promises that arise in response to an explicit  question by the presenter of the show are uninformative about behavior.

To test this  prediction, 2 studies were run. In each, participants faced a dilemma in  which they could choose to benefit themselves, the group, or other  group members as individuals. In Study 1, empathy for another group  member was manipulated; in Study 2, naturally occurring empathic  response was determined by self-report. In both studies, participants  who experienced high empathy allocated more resources to the target of  empathy, reducing the overall collective good. These results suggest the  importance of considering self-interest, collective interest, and  other-interest (altruism) as three distinct motives, each of which may  operate in social dilemmas.

Sex heterogeneity hurts the voluntary provision of public goods  because women\u2014but not men\u2014contribute less in mixed-sex than same-sex  groups.

In this paper, we argue that costly signaling theory, a well-established  framework in biology and economics, may be useful to shed light on the  individual differences in human unconditional altruism. Based on costly  signaling theory, we propose and show that unconditional altruistic behavior  is related to general intelligence. The cost incurred by engaging in  unconditional altruism is lower for highly intelligent people than for  less intelligent people because they may expect to regain the drained  resources. As a result, unconditional altruism can serve as an honest  signal of intelligence. Our findings imply that distinguishing  altruistic behavior from cooperative behavior in social psychological  and economic theories of human behavior might be useful and that costly  signaling theory may provide novel insights on various individual  difference variables.","557":"nan","558":"We  tested the hypothesis that physically more attractive men are less  likely to cooperate in social exchange than less attractive men, while  physical attractiveness has no effect on women's tendency toward  cooperation, with four different experimental games (Prisoner's Dilemma  with 99 players, Allocator Choice with 77 players, Faith with 16  players, and Trust with 21 players). Pictures of the game players were  taken after they participated in one of the four games, and those  pictures were presented to another set of participants (85 raters in  Study 1 and 2, 36 raters in Study 3) for attractiveness ratings. Both  male and female raters who were unaware of the photographed game  players' actual behavior in the game judged the faces of male defectors  (who defected in one of the four games) to be more attractive than those  of male cooperators, but they did not give differential attractiveness  ratings to female defectors and female cooperators.","559":"Many  environmental problems are resource dilemmas that contain two  components\u2013social and temporal\u2013that encourage individuals not to act in  the best interest of the group. Most research has focused on the social  component. The authors examined the importance of the temporal component  in two resource dilemma tasks. Participants (N = 112) reported their  willingness to limit resource consumption in response to hypothetical  dilemmas and forfeited extra credit points in response to a real  dilemma. Cooperation rates were higher when the temporal dilemma was  diminished, when uncertainty about environmental impacts was low, and  for women. Individuals high in both proenvironmentalism and  consideration of future consequences sustained high levels of  cooperation even in the face of strong temporal dilemmas.","560":"Do  cultural values influence the manner in which people cooperate with one  another? This study assessed cultural characteristics of individuals  and then related these characteristics to cooperative behavior in social  dilemmas. Participants were assessed for their degree of vertical and  horizontal individualism and collectivism, cultural values identified by  Triandis (1995). They made choices in either a single-group or an  intergroup social dilemma. The single-group dilemma entailed a  three-person dilemma; the intergroup dilemma was identical but added  subgroup competition, i.e., an opposing three-person group. The results  indicated an interaction between cultural characteristics and type of  dilemma for cooperation. The single-group versus intergroup effect  reported by Bornstein and Ben-Yossef (1994) was replicated, but only for  vertical individualists. The vertical individualists were least  cooperative in the single-group dilemma but were more cooperative in the  intergroup dilemma\u2014where cooperation with the group maximized personal  outcomes. The vertical collectivists were most cooperative in the  single-group dilemma but were less cooperative in the intergroup  dilemma\u2014 where group defection resulted in maximum group outcomes. The  horizontal individualists and collectivists exhibited an intermediate  level of cooperation, with no differences in cooperation between the  single-group and intergroup dilemmas. Taken together, the results  suggest that the relationship between cultural values and cooperation,  in particular with reference to vertical and horizontal components of  individualism and collectivism, is more complex than has been suggested  in past research.","561":"  Abstract  Behavior in social\u2010dilemma (mixed\u2010motive) situations has  been of great interest to economists, psychologists, and negotiation  scholars. In this study, we used a threshold social\u2010dilemma game to  examine factors that have not yet been investigated and that may have an  impact on behavior in these settings: gender and group identity. We  found that, for women, interacting with members of a naturally occurring  group increased coordination and efficiency, while for men, interacting  with members of a naturally occurring group decreased coordination and  efficiency. Psychological literature on gender differences and group  interdependence explains these differences.

","562":"Human  cooperation in a large group of genetically unrelated people is an  evolutionary puzzle. Despite its costly nature, cooperative behavior is  commonly found in all human societies\u2014a fact that has interested  researchers from a wide range of disciplines, including biology,  economics, and psychology, to name a few. Many behavioral experiments  have demonstrated that cooperation within a group can be sustained when  free riders are punished. We argue that punishment has both a direct  effect and an indirect effect on promoting cooperation. The direct  effect of punishment alters the consequences of cooperation and  defection in such a way as to make a rational person prefer cooperation.  The indirect effect of punishment promotes cooperation among  conditional cooperators by providing the condition necessary for their  cooperation (i.e., the expectation that other members will also  cooperate). Here we present data from two one-shot n-person  prisoner's dilemma games, demonstrating that the indirect effect of  punishment complements the direct effect to increase cooperation in the  game. Furthermore, we show that direct and indirect effects are robust  across two forms of punishment technology: either when punishment is  voluntarily provided by game players themselves or when it is  exogenously provided by the experimenter.","563":"In  social decision making, punishing non-cooperation and rewarding  cooperation may not only affect cooperation because of instrumental  reasons. They may also evoke moral concerns regarding cooperation as  they signal that cooperation is socially approved of and non-cooperation  socially disapproved of. I argue that punishments do this to a greater  extent than rewards as punishments communicate an obligatory rule and  rewards communicate a voluntary rule. Indeed, the first experiment shows  that, in a social dilemma, the concept of punishment increased  cooperation and the concept of a reward did not. The second experiment  showed that participants showed more disapproval towards an offender  when there was a punishment for non-compliance than when there was a  reward for compliance. These findings suggest that punishing  non-cooperation more strongly foster moral concerns regarding  cooperation than rewarding cooperation. Possible implications for internalizations are discussed.","564":"Recent  work on public goods contributions has examined the relationship  between gender and free-riding behavior in studies using laboratory  public goods.

However, the  present study shows that not only the structure but also the content or  context of the situation is important. This study consisted of two  parts.

These data were factor analyzed and five factors were  distinguished. For three factors the situations with high loadings had  structural aspects in common and for two other factors the situations  with high loadings dealt with the same content or issue.

Participants played a  Prisoner's Dilemma game five times, each time with a different partner.  Two of the five partners were ingroup members, two were outgroup  members, and the nationality of one partner was not known. Furthermore,  one of the two ingroup (or outgroup) partners knew that the participant  was a member of the same (or the other) nationality, and the other did  not know it. The results indicated that the knowledge that the partner  had about the nationality of the participant exerted an effect only when  the partner was an ingroup member. No major difference was found  between Australian and Japanese participants. An outgroup\u2010favoring  cooperation pattern was observed, but that pattern was shown to be a  result of fairness concerns among Australian participants and of  positive stereotypes of Australians among Japanese participants.

In Experiment 1, we found that those with many  endowments contributed more than those with few endowments in a public  good dilemma without a sanctioning system present, whereas those with  many endowments did not contribute more than those with few endowments  toward the implementation of a sanctioning system. The latter effect,  however, was eliminated when participants were accountable (i.e., when  expectations that they would have to justify their decisions to others  in the group were high). Experiment 2 showed that when participants were  accountable, the contributions of those with many endowments (and not  those with few endowments) toward the sanctioning system increased, but  only when they perceived the group to be more self-evaluative in terms  of morality (i.e., high-evaluation expectancy).

(The PDG-Alt matrix is a prisoner's dilemma game matrix that  adds a third withdrawal choice to the usual cooperative and  uncooperative choices of the PDG matrix, and interindividual-intergroup  discontinuity is the tendency of intergroup relations to be more  competitive and less cooperative than interindividual relations.)  Several predictions implied by the fear and greed explanations of  interindividual-intergroup discontinuity were tested. One prediction, an  implication of the fear hypothesis, is that communication should  produce a larger increase in the cooperation of individuals than of  groups. This prediction is based partially on the assumption that the  outgroup schema, which leads to more fear of groups than of individuals,  should reduce the credibility of between group communication. Given,  however, that without communication individuals may not cooperate, what  will they do? Will they withdraw or will they compete? Another  prediction, an implication of the greed hypothesis, is that the absence  of communication should result in a greater increase in withdrawal for  individuals than for groups. This prediction is based partially on the  assumption that the social support provided to fellow group members for  self-interested competitiveness is absent for individuals. These  predictions were confirmed. It was argued that the lesser tendency of  individuals to cooperate when there is no communication with the  opponent may explain partially the differing results of past  discontinuity research (which has involved communication) and research  reported in the PDG literature (which typically has not involved  communication).","573":"Markets  are experimentally constructed to test for differences in choice  behavior attributable to gender.

This  article begins with the observation that people often cooperate in  social dilemmas. Specifically, they may do so either for altruistic  reasons or for reasons indirectly linked to self\u2010interest. Because these  competing motivations exist in different contexts, we explore the  consequences of the incorporation of altruism in the economic framework  in the context of a series of prisoner's dilemma experiments. Our  experiments involve student subjects in groups of three. Each student  plays two rounds of a monetary prisoner's dilemma game with the other  two subjects in that group. We find evidence for recognizably different  levels of the altruistic behavior of cooperation due to personal  attributes and specific experimental conditions. Cooperation rates are  higher for female students and more senior students. Of more interest is  the evidence that economics majors tend to behave more cooperatively  than noneconomics majors.

Wilke, In European Review of Social Psychology,  Wiley, New York, Vol. 2, pp. 165\u2013187, 1991) states that people in  resource dilemmas are greedy and wish to defect, but that greed is  constrained by preferences for efficient resource use and fair  distributions. This paper reviews research where the GEF hypothesis was  generalized to public-goods dilemmas. Results from both surveys and  experiments on people's willingness to contribute to resources for  social services were interpreted in light of the GEF hypothesis. Whereas  earlier research on social dilemmas and fairness considerations have  focused on the correlation between estimated fair and actual cooperation  rates, the present results provide an extension where cooperation rates  are influenced by perceived fairness of how a resource is distributed.  Two experiments contribute further insights into the interplay, in terms  of effects on cooperation, between greed, efficiency, and fairness. The  collective consequences of individual choices were either highlighted  or not (Experiment 1) and the outcome structure in prior social dilemma  tasks was either collectively or individually framed (Experiment 2).  These manipulations influenced (a) cooperation rates and (b) the extent  to which decisions were based on greed, efficiency, or fairness.","577":"Following  earlier demonstrations of more competitiveness between groups than  between individuals in the context of a PDG matrix, two additional  conditions were studied. These were a group-all condition in which the  intergroup contact involved all the members in both groups (rather than  just representatives as in the previously studied group-representative  condition), and an interdependence condition in which physically  separated individuals shared their winnings with the other subjects on  the same side of the suite of rooms (rather than neither giving winnings  to nor receiving winnings from other such subjects as in the previously  studied individuals condition). The results indicated that there was a  large overall tendency for the group-representative and group-all  conditions to be more competitive than the individuals and  interdependence conditions, that the group-representative condition was  more competitive than the group-all condition, and that the  interdependence condition and individuals condition did not differ. The  difference between the group-representative and group-all condition was  interpreted as consistent with a prediction that intergroup contact can  reduce competitiveness even when there is conflict and the absence of  norms requiring cooperative behavior. The lack of difference between the  interdependence condition and the individuals condition was interpreted  as inconsistent with an altruisticrationalization hypothesis according  to which group members rationalize their competitiveness toward the  other group as being enacted for the sake of fellow group members.","578":" This  study examines how advertising budget setting, framed as a prisoner's  dilemma, is affected by information on the competitive situation and  characteristics of the decision maker.

In the first, two  same-sex individuals or two same-sex dyads played 10 trials of a  Prisoner's Dilemma matrix game (PDG) for money. Play between individuals  was more cooperative and less competitive than play between groups. In  the second experiment subjects played 10 trials of either PDG or  mutual-fate-control (MFC) matrices. For the MFC matrix the competitive  choice, which reduces the opponent's outcomes, but has no effect on own  outcomes, reflects a desire to increase one's relative advantage over  the opponent. Although cooperation was greater for MFC, for both PDG and  MFC matrices groups were more competitive and less cooperative than  individuals. A large component of the groups-individuals effect is  attributed to the greater desire of groups to \u201cwin\u201d or avoid \u201closing\u201d to  the opponent, regardless of their absolute outcomes.","580":"An  important question facing those interested in comparative eco nomic  systems is how well the assumptions underlying market economic models  fit in nonmarket contexts.

Dependent variables are choices and guesses about other's next choice.  In one experiment, all subjects saw all conditions while in the other,  only level of feedback changed for each subject. Results show a  significant main effect of orientation, feedback, and risk on choices  and correlation between guesses and choices in some but not all  conditions. In one experiment, hypotheses about interaction effects  derived from the trust model are supported while in the other experiment  no interaction effects appear.","586":"Deception  and self-deception may be two related psychological capacities serving  to enhance an individual's inclusive fitness. Self-deception has been  defined as any psychological act in which one thought or belief is held  at the expense of another. This study was designed to test the notion  that we may deceive ourselves about our own intentions or the intentions  of others in order to facilitate cooperation, if the cooperative  behavior has the potential to improve fitness. We may also deceive  ourselves in situations where we may need to compete with others, if not  competing might represent a loss of fitness. The Self-Deceptio  Questionnaire was administered to 80 women and 70 men to determine their  levels of self-deception. A series of vignettes, conforming to the  Prisoner's Dilemma game format, were administered in questionnaire  material to measure participant's predispositions to cooperate or defect  in three different contexts (family, mating, and neutral). Men  predicted they would be less cooperative than women over all conditions,  and participants anticipated cooperating more with kin than with  non-kin. Moreover, participants who were high self-deceivers chose more  cooperative responses in both family and mating contexts than those with  low self-deception scores. Finally, the three-way interaction among  sex, context, and level of self-deception suggested that the role of  selfdeception in cooperation may vary according to the sex of the  individual and the context.","587":"The  familiar two-person prisoner's dilemma (PD) game can be considered a  special case of a general family of games with more than two players.  This family of games is of particular interest, having been suggested as  a model for a variety of social conflict situations. A subset of this  family of games, called the uniform PD, is defined, for which the  members of the subset may be scaled along a dimension of  competitiveness for any given number of players. An index of  competitiveness was derived and tested for the three-person case. Sixty  volunteer subjects played one of five three-person uniform PD games,  chosen to vary across the range of values of the index. Each triad  played 150 trials of the same game for points which were converted to  cash at the end of the experiment. Subjects were run in triads  homogeneous with respect to sex; effects due to that variable were  absent. The obtained proportions of cooperative response were found to  be strongly related to the value of the index.

The final level of payoff in this condition is comparable to  those conditions without the gates.

The results from these studies are used to develop a  theoretical model that postulates that the relationship between  sanctions and cooperation is due to both a signaling effect, in which  sanctions influence the type of decision that is perceived to be made,  and a processing effect, in which the decision processing, including  whether or not the strength of the sanction is considered, depends on  the decision frame evoked.

Explanations of the  motivation to punish generally rely either on small group size or on a  Folk theorem that requires coordinated punishment and, hence, highly  accurate information concerning the behavior of each player. We provide a  model of team production in which the punishment of shirkers depends on  strong reciprocity: the willingness of some team members to  contribute altruistically to a joint project and also to bear costs in  order to discipline fellow members who do not contribute. This  alternative does not require small group size, complex coordinated  punishing activities, or implausible informational assumptions.

In this paper rewards and sanctions are examined in a  one-shot VCM setting that so far has been unexplored in the literature.  The study finds that while some subjects are willing to reward and  sanction others at a personal cost, the opportunity to reward or  sanction is ineffective in facilitating cooperation relative to previous  experiments in which a repeated game environment is employed. The study  also compares behavior in an environment in which the imposition of  rewards and sanctions is certain to an environment in which imposition  is uncertain. The expected value of the reward or sanction is kept  constant across environments to focus simply on the effect of  uncertainty about imposition. Uncertainty does not change behavior in a  significant way, either in the level of cooperation or the willingness  of individuals to impose rewards or sanctions.","635":"In  social dilemmas, where personal welfare is in conflict with collective  welfare, there are inherent incentives to act non-cooperatively.

Two studies are reported that examine the functional relationship  between the number of likely bad apples and individual cooperation, and  whether and when the threat of social exclusion for uncooperative  behavior may effectively counter the temptation to follow the example of  such \u201cbad apples\u201d. It is shown that (a) the threat of exclusion is  sufficient to counter the temptation to follow a few bad apples\u2019  example, (b) such threats cannot, however, overcome the  cooperation-degrading effects of large numbers (e.g., a majority) of bad  apples, and (c) the effectiveness of such threats may be greater in  relatively smaller groups.","636":"  Abstract  In this article, we examine how being assigned the role of  leader affects behaviour in resource sharing tasks. Previous research  has shown that group members anchor their decision on the equal division  rule prescribing that resources should be distributed equally.  Following notions of equity theory and the literature on role schemas,  we expected that adherence to the equal division rule would be moderated  by role assignment. In particular, we expected leaders to take more  than followers from a common resource and that this effect would be  explained in terms of feelings of entitlement. The results of two  experimental studies corroborate this reasoning. Study 1 demonstrated  that leaders took more than followers and that leaders deviated more  strongly from the equal division rule. In Study 2, it was found that  legitimate leaders took more from the resource and deviated more  strongly from the equal division rule than non\u2010legitimate leaders.  Additional analyses suggest that the leaders' tendency to make higher  allocations to the self can be explained by feelings of entitlement.  Copyright \u00a9 2005 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

Instrumental cooperation occurs when members cooperate to  introduce a change in the incentive structure (such as the provision of a  sanctioning system) so as to eliminate the dilemma from the original  situation. The results of a social dilemma experiment, using 48 same-sex  four-person groups, indicate that (a) in the absence of a sanctioning  system, greater temptation ot defect makes the subjects cooperate less  fully, whereas (b) when opportunities to cooperate in a sanctioning  system exist, greater temptation to defect in the original dilemma makes  the subjects cooperative more fully for the provision or maintenance of  the sanctioning system when the gain for cooperation is large. The  implication of these findings is that as the social dilemma becomes more  serious, people become more willing to cooperate in provinding a change  in the system which addresses the dilemma problem.","638":"Two  studies were conducted to determine whether information about the  actions of others in a multitrial social dilemma can influence choice  behavior.

Study 1, which used a  prisoner\u2019s dilemma, showed that participant rates of cooperation  conformed to those reported for similar, but not dissimilar, others.  Study 2 added outcome information to the person descriptions and changed  the game to a public goods dilemma. Cooperation rates were directly  influenced by similar others when others\u2019 choices were described as  having produced large outcomes; when choices were said to have produced  small outcomes, rate of cooperation was inversely related to others\u2019  behavior.

In three laboratory studies, we examine the idea that how people are  selected for the leader role (i.e. election or appointment) determines  whether leaders take more or equal shares (relative to followers) from a  common resource. In a first experiment, we show that participants were  more accepting of norm violating behavior by an appointed versus elected  leader. In a second experiment, we show that when participants were  assigned to a leader or follower role, allocations of appointed leaders  differed significantly from those of elected leaders and followers,  whereas there was no difference between the two latter conditions.  Moreover, elected leaders were shown to feel more social responsibility  than both appointed leaders and followers. In a final experiment, we  show that when participants were primed with the concept of social  responsibility (relative to a neutral condition) no difference in  allocations between appointed and elected leaders emerged.","640":"  Abstract  This research investigates the role of intermittent monetary  costs in restraining individuals from defection in social dilemmas. In  Experiment 1, 104 car owners made fictitious choices between a slow and a  fast travel mode in the context of a continuous social dilemma. There  were four different conditions of monetary costs for choosing the fast  mode (defection): no cost, low cost, high cost to self, or high cost to  others. Participants defected most when there was no cost and least when  they themselves were charged a high cost. A spill\u2010over effect was  obtained such that when others were charged a high cost to defect,  defection rates were lower than under no cost. Experiment 2 used 36  undergraduates as participants in an iterated decision task with real  groups. The results replicated the major results of Experiment 1.  Furthermore, whereas prosocials were strongly affected by intermittent  costs for defection (i.e. showed large spill\u2010over effects), proselfs  seemed to be unaffected.

This paper studies the effects of feedback about  collective (in)efficiency and the influence of the presence or absence  of a sanctioning system. The results show that, except after feedback  about collective inefficiency, people were reluctant to support  installation of a sanctioning system. When a sanctioning system was  already present, however, sanction support was strong and not affected  by feedback. Interestingly, the presence of a sanctioning system  increased pessimism about attaining collective efficiency. This suggests  that the mere presence of a sanctioning system creates the need to have  that sanctioning system, and that installing one can have irreversible  consequences.","642":"Common  pool resource (CPR) dilemmas constitute a class of social dilemmas in  which equilibrium behavior results in Pareto deficient outcomes that are  not at all desirable by the group. We focus on a class of CPR dilemmas  that, in addition to strategic uncertainty about the harvesting behavior of the other group members, include environmental uncertainty  about the size of the CPR. In an attempt to decrease the rate of  requests from the common pool, and thereby increase individual payoffs,  we extend previous research\u2014both theoretically and experimentally\u2014in two  different directions. In the bonus treatment, a reward is given to the  agent(s) who requests the least, and in the penalty treatment, a charge  is imposed on the agent(s) who requests the most. We show that under  equilibrium play the bonus treatment decreases total group request,  whereas the penalty treatment increases it. Our experimental results do  not support this prediction. Rather, both treatments considerably  decrease the rate of request and, therefore, increase the rate of  provision. The penalty treatment is shown to be more effective in  reducing individual requests and enhancing provision rates than the  bonus treatment.","643":"If  self-interested behavior conflicts with the collective welfare, rules  of cooperation are often installed to prevent egoistic behavior. We  hypothesized that installing such rules may instigate personal moral  norms of cooperation, but that they fail in doing so when installed by a  leader who is self-interested rather than self-sacrificing. Three  studies confirmed this and also showed that, consequently, only  self-sacrificing leaders were able to install rules that increase  cooperation without the need for a perfectly operating monitoring  system.","644":"In  an experiment simulating management of a common forest, members of  four-person groups planted seedlings and harvested trees as they grew.

This rule factor was crossed with the voting factor (voting vs.  no-voting). In the voting condition, group members could vote during the  latter half of the experiment for one of the above two rules. It was  predicted that equality-assigned groups would experience the devastating  consequences of defective actions so that they would vote for the  punishment rule more than would punishment-assigned groups which would  not experience such devastating consequences. Results for the experiment  supported this prediction.

This makes it  difficult to determine how a cooperation reward motivates cooperation.  This study systematically examined various components of cooperation  reward schemes so as to help identify the general properties of an  effective cooperation reward. Specifically, three features of a  cooperation reward were manipulated: the number of group members who can  receive the reward; when the reward is given; and whether reward  reception is contingent upon performance. Four major effects emerged.  First, performance-contingent, per-trial rewards produced high rates of  cooperation. Second, competitive, performance-based rewards effectively  maintained cooperation across trials. Next, a competitive,  performance-based, per-trial reward scheme outperformed any other reward  scheme in terms of rate of cooperation induced. Finally, rewards that  were provided for simply participating in the group had an inhibitory  effect on cooperation, producing a lesser rate of cooperation than  baseline.","648":"Apex  games place weak players in the formal equivalent of a multiperson  prisoner's dilemma in which each weak player must choose between  competing against the other weak players for the opportunity to coalesce  with the strong player or cooperating with the other weak players to  produce a jointly preferable outcome.

Fifty-four groups of four subjects each played the weak role in a  five-person apex game with a confederate playing the apex (strong) role  in a 3\u00d73 design with factors of low, medium, and high levels of rewards  and punishments available as incentives. As predicted, punishments but  not rewards had a significant impact on increasing cooperation. Despite  this effect, many groups experienced harmful effects of punishment  availability that increased the risk of retaliatory spirals. It is  concluded that a second-order dilemma may be seen in prisoner's  dilemmas, since punishments are both necessary for enforcing cooperation  and detrimental to that cooperation.","649":"AMODIFIED  PRISONER'S DILEMMA GAME WITH THE INCLUSION OF A 3RD CHOICE WAS USED IN 2  RELATED EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF 2 VARIABLES ON  COOPERATIVE CHOICE: (1) POWER TO PUNISH UNDER UNILATERAL AND BILATERAL  CONDITIONS, AND (2) HOW THE POWER IS USED.

In line with the integrative model of  social value orientation, it was expected that prosocials differ from  proselfs in their level of cooperation because they wish to maximize own  and other's outcomes (i.e. paralleling the norm of social  responsibility) and enhance equality in outcomes (i.e. paralleling the  norm of reciprocity). Study 1 revealed that prosocials felt more  responsible to further the group's interest than proselfs did and this  social responsibility feeling appeared to account for choice  differences. Study 2 revealed that prosocials were more likely to  reciprocate their partner's actions than were proselfs. Also, feelings  of social responsibility did not account for this observation,  suggesting that enhancing joint outcomes and equality in outcomes  constitute two relatively independent dimensions.

The  results corroborate our line of reasoning. When the size of the resource  was certain, proselfs as well as prosocials anchored their decisions on  the equal division rule.

Noncooperators increased their harvests during this period,  while cooperators harvested less and held their harvests constant across  these trials.

Contrary to expectations, not only prosocials  care about equality in outcomes. In Study 1, the authors found that  individualists choose to forego personal gains, despite obvious selfish  reasons to cooperate, when outcomes were distributed unequally. In a  second experiment, this finding was replicated and shows that  individualists, just as prosocials, demand equality in outcomes in  interdependent situations.

Applying  meta-analytic techniques, we harness a relatively recent explosion of  research on intergroup discrimination in cooperative decision making to  address several fundamental unresolved issues. First, summarizing  evidence across studies, we find a small to medium effect size  indicating that people are more cooperative with ingroup, compared to  outgroup, members (d = 0.32). Second, we forward and test predictions  about the conditions that moderate ingroup favoritism from 2 influential  perspectives: a social identity approach and a bounded generalized  reciprocity perspective. Although we find evidence for a slight tendency  for ingroup favoritism through categorization with no mutual  interdependence between group members (e.g., dictator games; d = 0.19),  situations that contain interdependence result in stronger ingroup  favoritism (e.g., social dilemmas; d = 0.42). We also find that ingroup  favoritism is stronger when there is common (vs. unilateral) knowledge  of group membership, and stronger during simultaneous (vs. sequential)  exchanges. Third, we find support for the hypothesis that intergroup  discrimination in cooperation is the result of ingroup favoritism rather  than outgroup derogation. Finally, we test for additional moderators of  ingroup favoritism, such as the percentage of men in the sample,  experimental versus natural groups, and the country of participants. We  discuss the implications of these findings for theoretical perspectives  on ingroup favoritism, address implications for the methodologies used  to study this phenomenon, and suggest directions for future research.

Here, we have linked oxytocin, a neuropeptide produced in  the hypothalamus, to the regulation of intergroup conflict.

We examine two bases for the  expectation of a partner's cooperation in one-shot games: `general  trust' and a `sense of control'. Further, we discuss why we expect  general trust and a `sense of control'. Further, we discuss why we  expect general trust and a sense of control to play different roles in  societies, particularly in Japanese society and American society.  Specifically, we test a general hypothesis that a sense of control plays  a relatively more important role as a foundation for expectations in  Japanese society and general trust plays the more important role in  American society.","672":"To  test the hypothesis that sensitivity to monitoring drives people to act  altruistically toward members of their own community, two experiments  investigated whether an eye-like painting promotes altruism  toward in-group members, but not toward out-group members.

Participants knew whether their recipient was an in-group member or an  out-group member, but were informed that their recipient did not know  the group membership of the dictator. In-group favoritism occurred only  when participants were facing a computer desktop which displayed a  painting of eyes, but did not occur in the absence of eyes. These  findings demonstrate that the eye painting displayed on the  participant's computer screen worked as a cue for monitoring and thus  enhanced the participant's altruistic behavior.","673":" Abstract      Economists are increasingly interested in how group membership  affects individual behavior. The standard method assigns individuals to  \"minimal\" groups, i.e. arbitrary labels, in a lab. But real group often  involve social interactions leading to social ties between group  members. Our experiments compare randomly assigned minimal groups to  randomly assigned groups involving real social interactions. While  adding social ties leads to qualitatively similar, although stronger, in-group favoritism in cooperation, altruistic norm  enforcement patterns are qualitatively different between treatments.

One  possibility is that cooperation can pay through developing a reputation  that makes one more likely to be chosen for a profitable cooperative  partnership, a process termed competitive altruism (CA) or  reputation-based partner choice. Here, we show, to our knowledge, for  the first time, that investing in a cooperative reputation can bring net  benefits through access to more cooperative partners. Participants  played a public goods game (PGG) followed by an opportunity to select a  partner for a second cooperative game. We found that those who gave more  in the PGG were more often selected as desired partners and received  more in the paired cooperative game. Reputational competition was even  stronger when it was possible for participants to receive a higher  payoff from partner choice. The benefits of being selected by a more  cooperative partner outweighed the costs of cooperation in the  reputation building phase. CA therefore provides an alternative to  indirect reciprocity as an explanation for reputation-building  behaviour. Furthermore, while indirect reciprocity depends upon  individuals giving preference to those of good standing, CA can explain  unconditional cooperation.","675":"Firms  are often organized into groups.

In the presence of  cues of competition between groups, a taste for harming the out-group  emerges: punishment ceases to serve a norm enforcement function, and  instead, out-group members are punished harder and regardless of whether  they cooperate or defect. Our results point to a mechanism that might  help explain previous mixed results on the social value of punishment,  and they contribute to understanding the sources of conflict between  groups.

When the  population has group structure, as is often found in social networks,  players in experiments are considered to show behavior that deviates  from existing theoretical models of indirect reciprocity. First, players  often show ingroup favoritism (i.e., cooperation only within the group)  rather than full cooperation (i.e., cooperation within and across  groups), even though the latter is Pareto efficient. Second, in general,  humans approximate outgroup members' personal characteristics,  presumably including the reputation used for indirect reciprocity, by a  single value attached to the group. Humans use such a stereotypic  approximation, a phenomenon known as outgroup homogeneity in social  psychology. I propose a model of indirect reciprocity in populations  with group structure to examine the possibility of ingroup favoritism  and full cooperation. In accordance with outgroup homogeneity, I assume  that players approximate outgroup members' personal reputations by a  single reputation value attached to the group. I show that ingroup  favoritism and full cooperation are stable under different social norms  (i.e., rules for assigning reputations) such that they do not coexist in  a single model. If players are forced to consistently use the same  social norm for assessing different types of interactions (i.e., ingroup  versus outgroup interactions), only full cooperation survives. The  discovered mechanism is distinct from any form of group selection. The  results also suggest potential methods for reducing ingroup bias to  shift the equilibrium from ingroup favoritism to full cooperation.Highlights\u25ba  I study a model of ingroup favoritism based on indirect reciprocity. \u25ba  Reputation values are assigned to groups as well as to individuals. \u25ba I  reveal the conditions for ingroup favoritism and perfect cooperation.","677":"<jats:p> Two experiments utilized a new experimental paradigm\u2014the Intergroup Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\u2014 Maximizing Difference (IPD-MD) game\u2014to study how relative deprivation at the group level affects intergroup competition. The IPD-MD game enables group members to make a costly contribution to either a within-group pool that benefits fellow ingroup members, or a between-group pool, which, in addition, harms outgroup members. We found that when group members were put in a disadvantaged position, either by previous actions of the outgroup (Experiment 1) or by random misfortune (Experiment 2), they contributed substantially more to the competitive between-group pool. This destructive behavior both minimized inequality between the groups and reduced collective efficiency. Our results underscore the conditions that lead group members to care about relative (rather than absolute) group outcomes and highlight the need to differentiate between the motivation to get ahead and the motivation not to fall behind: the latter, it appears, is what motivates individual participation in destructive intergroup competition. <\/jats:p>","678":"We  investigate inter-ethnic trust and reciprocity by having subjects from  distinct ethnic origins play the trust game [Games Econom.

We study this problem by considering a  prisoner's dilemma game with four strategies: altruists who cooperate  with everyone; parochialists who only cooperate with members of their  own group; traitors who only cooperate with outgroup individuals; and  egoists who never cooperate. We develop a model that allows for both  assortment and conflict between groups. Individuals discriminate between  in- and outgroup members. While assortment and conflict allow for the  evolution of both indiscriminate and parochial altruism, discriminate  behavior creates an advantage for parochialists over altruists, as the  latter waste help on outgroup members. We use computer simulations to  study the multilevel selection dynamics. The simulation model describes  an absorbing Markov chain.  We examine the absorption probabilities of altruists and parochialists.  Three model versions are compared, with only assortment, with only  group conflict, and with both mechanisms. We find that parochialism is  selected for by group conflict as well as assortment.

However, prior  studies have neglected to assess the process measures necessary to pit  the one account against the other.

The relative  importance of these two needs was expected to vary with the salience of  group membership (social vs personal identity). This hypothesis was  supported in two experiments.

Furthermore,  Experiment 2 showed that highly committed leaders were more influential  when social identity was salient, whereas leaders with intrinsic  leadership skills were more influential when personal identity was  salient.

This \u201ccollective-risk social dilemma\u201d exists in  various social scenarios, the globally most challenging one being the  prevention of dangerous climate change. Reaching the collective target  requires individual sacrifice, with benefits to all but no guarantee  that others will also contribute. It even seems tempting to contribute  less and save money to induce others to contribute more, hence the  dilemma and the risk of failure. Here, we introduce the collective-risk  social dilemma and simulate it in a controlled experiment: Will a group  of people reach a fixed target sum through successive monetary  contributions, when they know they will lose all their remaining money  with a certain probability if they fail to reach the target sum? We find  that, under high risk of simulated dangerous climate change, half of  the groups succeed in reaching the target sum, whereas the others only  marginally fail. When the risk of loss is only as high as the necessary  average investment or even lower, the groups generally fail to reach the  target sum. We conclude that one possible strategy to relieve the  collective-risk dilemma in high-risk situations is to convince people  that failure to invest enough is very likely to cause grave financial  loss to the individual. Our analysis describes the social window  humankind has to prevent dangerous climate change. cooperationpublic goodthreshold ","700":"We  study the effect of group size on cooperation in voluntary contribution  mechanism games. As in previous experiments, we study four- and  eight-person groups in high and low marginal per capita return (MPCR)  conditions. We find a positive effect of group size in the low MPCR  condition, as in previous experiments. However, in the high MPCR  condition we observe a negative group size effect. We extend the design  to investigate two- and three-person groups in the high MPCR condition,  and find that cooperation is highest of all in two-person groups. The  findings in the high MPCR condition are consistent with those from n-person  prisoner\u2019s dilemma and oligopoly experiments that suggest it is more  difficult to sustain cooperation in larger groups. The findings from the  low MPCR condition suggest that this effect can be overridden. In  particular, when cooperation is low other factors, such as  considerations of the social benefits of contributing (which increase  with group size), may dominate any negative group size effect.","701":"Reciprocity  or conditional cooperation is one of the most prominent mechanisms  proposed to explain the emergence of cooperation in social dilemmas.  Recent experimental findings on networked games suggest that conditional  cooperation may also depend on the previous action of the player. We  here report on experiments on iterated, multi-player Prisoner's dilemma,  on groups of 2 to 5 people. We confirm the dependence on the previous  step and that memory effects for earlier periods are not significant. We  show that the behavior of subjects in pairwise dilemmas is  qualitatively different from the cases with more players; After an  initial decay, cooperation increases significantly reaching values above  80%. The strategy of the players is rather universal as far as their  willingness to reciprocate cooperation is concerned, whereas there is  much diversity in their initial propensity to cooperate. Our results  indicate that, for cooperation to emerge and thrive, three is a crowd.","702":"A  longstanding idea in the literature on human cooperation is that  cooperation should be reinforced when conditional cooperators are more  likely to interact. In the context of social networks, this idea implies  that cooperation should fare better in highly clustered networks such  as cliques than in networks with low clustering such as random networks.  To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of web-based  experiments, in which 24 individuals played a local public goods game  arranged on one of five network topologies that varied between  disconnected cliques and a random regular graph. In contrast with  previous theoretical work, we found that network topology had no  significant effect on average contributions. This result implies either  that individuals are not conditional cooperators, or else that  cooperation does not benefit from positive reinforcement between  connected neighbors. We then tested both of these possibilities in two  subsequent series of experiments in which artificial seed players were  introduced, making either full or zero contributions. First, we found  that although players did generally behave like conditional cooperators,  they were as likely to decrease their contributions in response to low  contributing neighbors as they were to increase their contributions in  response to high contributing neighbors. Second, we found that positive  effects of cooperation were contagious only to direct neighbors in the  network. In total we report on 113 human subjects experiments,  highlighting the speed, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of web-based  experiments over those conducted in physical labs. ","703":"The  benefits of a good reputation can help explain why some individuals are  willing to be altruistic in situations where they will not receive  direct benefits. Recent experiments on indirect reciprocity have shown  that when people stand to benefit from having a good reputation, they  are more altruistic towards groups and charities. However, it is unknown  whether indirect reciprocity is the only thing that can cause such an  effect. Individuals may be altruistic because it will make them more  trustworthy. In this study, I show that participants in a cooperative  group game contribute more to their group when they expect to play a  dyadic trust game afterwards, and that participants do tend to trust  altruistic individuals more than nonaltruistic individuals. I also  included a condition where participants had to choose only one person to  trust (instead of being able to trust all players) in the dyadic trust  game that followed the cooperative group game, and contributions towards  the group were maintained best in this condition. This provides some  evidence that competition for scarce reputational benefits can help  maintain cooperative behaviour because of competitive altruism.","704":"Two  factors that promote cooperation are partner choice and punishment of  defectors, but which option do people actually prefer to use? Punishment  is predicted to be more common when organisms cannot escape bad  partners, whereas partner choice is useful when one can switch to a  better partner. Here we use a modified iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma to  examine people\u2019s cooperation and punishment when partner choice was  possible and when it was not. The results show that cooperation was  higher when people could leave bad partners versus when they could not.  When they could not switch partners, people preferred to actively punish  defectors rather than withdraw. When they could switch, punishment and  switching were equally preferred. Contrary to our predictions,  punishment was higher when switching was possible, possibly because  cooperators could then desert the defector they had just punished.  Punishment did not increase defectors\u2019 subsequent cooperation. Our  results support the importance of partner choice in promoting human  cooperation and in changing the prevalence of punishment.","705":"Social  networks represent the structuring of interactions between group  members. Above all, many interactions are profoundly cooperative in  humans and other animals. In accordance with this natural observation,  theoretical work demonstrates that certain network structures favour the  evolution of cooperation. Yet, recent experimental evidence suggests  that static networks do not enhance cooperative behaviour in humans. By  contrast, dynamic networks do foster cooperation. However, costs  associated with dynamism such as time or resource investments in finding  and establishing new partnerships have been neglected so far. Here, we  show that human participants are much less likely to break links when  costs arise for building new links. Especially, when costs were high,  the network was nearly static. Surprisingly, cooperation levels in  Prisoner's Dilemma games were not affected by reduced dynamism in social  networks. We conclude that the mere potential to quit  collaborations is sufficient in humans to reach high levels of  cooperative behaviour. Effects of self-structuring processes or  assortment on the network played a minor role: participants simply  adjusted their cooperative behaviour in response to the threats of  losing a partner or of being expelled.","706":"In  public goods experiments, stochastic choice, censoring and motivational  heterogeneity give scope for disagreement over the extent of  unselfishness, and whether it is reciprocal or altruistic. We show that  these problems can be addressed econometrically, by estimating a finite  mixture model to isolate types, incorporating double censoring and a  tremble term. Most subjects act selfishly, but a substantial proportion  are reciprocal with altruism playing only a marginal role. Isolating  reciprocators enables a test of Sugden\u2019s model of voluntary  contributions. We estimate that reciprocators display a self-serving  bias relative to the model.","707":"  Abstract  This paper reports experiments designed to study strategic sophistication ,  the extent to which behavior in games reflects attempts to predict  others\u2019 decisions, taking their incentives into account. We study  subjects\u2019 initial responses to normal\u2010form games with various patterns  of iterated dominance and unique pure\u2010strategy equilibria without  dominance, using a computer interface that allowed them to search for  hidden payoff information, while recording their searches. Monitoring  subjects\u2019 information searches along with their decisions allows us to  better understand how their decisions are determined, and subjects\u2019  deviations from the search patterns suggested by equilibrium analysis  help to predict their deviations from equilibrium decisions.   ","708":"When  thinking under uncertainty, people often do not consider appropriately  each of the relevant branches of a decision tree, as required by  consequentialism. As a result they sometimes violate Savage's sure-thing  principle. In the Prisoner's Dilemma game, for example, many subjects  compete when they know that the opponent has competed and when they know  that the opponent has cooperated, but cooperate when they do not know  the opponent's response. Newcomb's Problem and Wason's selection task  are also interpreted as manifestations of nonconsequential decision  making and reasoning. The causes and implications of such behavior, and  the notion of quasi-magical thinking, are discussed.","709":"  Abstract  This article shows that identical offers in an ultimatum  game generate systematically different rejection rates depending on the  other offers that are available to the proposer. This result casts doubt  on the consequentialist practice in economics to define the utility of  an action solely in terms of the consequences of the action irrespective  of the set of alternatives. It means in particular that negatively  reciprocal behavior cannot be fully captured by equity models that are  exclusively based on preferences over the distribution of material  payoffs.   ","710":"We  ask whether conformity, copying the most observed behavior in a  population, affects free riding. Our model suggests that, if  sufficiently frequent at the start of a public goods game, conformity  will increase the growth rate of free riding. We confirm this prediction  in an experiment by showing that free riding grows faster when players  have the information necessary to conform. As a stricter test, we  econometrically estimate the dynamic on which the model is based and  find that, controlling for the payoff incentive to free ride, players  react significantly to the number of free riders in their groups.","711":"Members  of social groups face a trade-off between investing selfish effort for  themselves and investing cooperative effort to produce a shared group  resource. Many group resources are shared equitably: they may be  intrinsically non-excludable public goods, such as vigilance against  predators, or so large that there is little cost to sharing, such as  cooperatively hunted big game. However, group members' personal  resources, such as food hunted individually, may be monopolizable. In  such cases, an individual may benefit by investing effort in taking  others' personal resources, and in defending one's own resources against  others. We use a game theoretic \u201ctug-of-war\u201d model to predict that when  such competition over personal resources is possible, players will  contribute more towards a group resource, and also obtain higher payoffs  from doing so. We test and find support for these predictions in two  laboratory economic games with humans, comparing people's investment  decisions in games with and without the options to compete over personal  resources or invest in a group resource. Our results help explain why  people cooperatively contribute to group resources, suggest how a  tragedy of the commons may be avoided, and highlight unifying features  in the evolution of cooperation and competition in human and non-human  societies. ","712":"The  results of numerous economic games suggest that humans behave more  cooperatively than would be expected if they were maximizing selfish  interests. It has been argued that this is because individuals gain  satisfaction from the success of others, and that such prosocial  preferences require a novel evolutionary explanation. However, in  previous games, imperfect behavior would automatically lead to an  increase in cooperation, making it impossible to decouple any form of  mistake or error from prosocial cooperative decisions. Here we  empirically test between these alternatives by decoupling imperfect  behavior from prosocial preferences in modified versions of the public  goods game, in which individuals would maximize their selfish gain by  completely (100%) cooperating. We found that, although this led to  higher levels of cooperation, it did not lead to full cooperation, and  individuals still perceived their group mates as competitors. This is  inconsistent with either selfish or prosocial preferences, suggesting  that the most parsimonious explanation is imperfect behavior triggered  by psychological drives that can prevent both complete defection and  complete cooperation. More generally, our results illustrate the caution  that must be exercised when interpreting the evolutionary implications  of economic experiments, especially the absolute level of cooperation in  a particular treatment.","713":"It  has become an accepted paradigm that humans have \u201cprosocial  preferences\u201d that lead to higher levels of cooperation than those that  would maximize their personal financial gain. However, the existence of  prosocial preferences has been inferred post hoc from the results of  economic games, rather than with direct experimental tests. Here, we  test how behavior in a public-goods game is influenced by knowledge of  the consequences of actions for other players. We found that (i) individuals cooperate at similar levels, even when they are not informed that their behavior benefits others; (ii)  an increased awareness of how cooperation benefits others leads to a  reduction, rather than an increase, in the level of cooperation; and (iii)  cooperation can be either lower or higher than expected, depending on  experimental design. Overall, these results contradict the suggested  role of the prosocial preferences hypothesis and show how the complexity  of human behavior can lead to misleading conclusions from controlled  laboratory experiments.","714":"One  well-known solution to the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is the TIT FOR  TAT strategy. This strategy has three \u201ccharacteristics\u201d associated with  it. TIT FOR TAT is nice (cooperates on the first move of a game),  retaliatory (plays defect against an individual that defected on the  prior move), and forgiving (cooperates with an individual which has  defected in the past but cooperates in the present). Predator inspection  behavior in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) was examined in order  to determine whether guppies displayed these three characteristics.  Results indicate that while it can be quite difficult to translate the  abstract concepts of niceness, retaliation, and forgiveness into  measurable behaviors, the data support the hypothesis that guppies  display the three characteristics associated with the TIT FOR TAT  strategy.The \u201cselfish herd\u201d and \u201cdilution effect\u201d are discussed  as possible alternative explanations for the observed behavior. These  hypotheses alone were insufficient to explain the results.","715":"Researchers  have demonstrated that the presence of people with social preferences  has important economic implications. However, the empirical basis of  this research relies to a large extent on experiments that do not  provide anonymity between experimenter and subject. It has been argued  that this lack of experimenter\u2013subject anonymity may create selfish  incentives to engage in seemingly other-regarding behavior. If this were  the case, these experiments would overestimate the importance of social  preferences. Previous studies provide mixed results and methodological  differences within and across studies make it difficult to isolate the  impact of experimenter\u2013subject anonymity. In this paper we use a novel  procedure that allows us to examine the impact of the exact same  ceteris-paribus variation in anonymity on behavior in three of the most  commonly used games in the social preference literature. We find that  the introduction of experimenter\u2013subject anonymity has no significant  effect in any of the three games.","716":"Cooperative behavior is often assumed to depend on individuals'  characteristics, such as altruism and reasoning ability. Evidence is  mixed about what the precise impact of these characteristics is, as the  subjects of study are generally randomly paired, generating a  heterogeneous mix of the two characteristics. In this study we ex-ante  create four different groups of subjects by factoring their higher or  lower than the median scores in both altruism and reasoning ability.  Then we use these groups in order to analyze the joint effect of the two  characteristics on the individual choice of cooperating and on  successful paired cooperation. Subjects belonging to each group play  first 10 one-shot prisoner's dilemma (PD) games with ten random partners  and then three consecutive 10-round repeated PD games with three random  partners. In all games, we elicit players' beliefs regarding  cooperation using an incentive compatible method. Individuals with high  altruism are more optimistic about the cooperative behavior of the other  player in the one-shot game. They also show higher individual  cooperation and paired cooperation rates in the first repetitions of  this game. Contrary to the one-shot PD games where high reasoning  ability reduces the probability of playing cooperatively, the sign of  the relationship is inverted in the first repeated PD game, showing that  high reasoning ability individuals better adjust their behavior to the  characteristics of the game they are playing. In this sense, the joint  effect of reasoning ability and altruism is not linear, with reasoning  ability counteracting the cooperative effect of altruism in the one-shot  game and reinforcing it in the first repeated game. However, experience  playing the repeated PD games takes over the two individual  characteristics in explaining individual and paired cooperation. Thus,  in a (PD) setting, altruism and reasoning ability significantly affect  behavior in single encounters, while in repeated interactions individual  and paired cooperation reach similarly high levels independently of  these individual characteristics.","717":"Over  the last 25 years, more than a hundred dictator game experiments have  been published. This meta study summarises the evidence. Exploiting the  fact that most experiments had to fix parameters they did not intend to  test, in multiple regression the meta study is able to assess the effect  of single manipulations, controlling for a host of alternative  explanatory factors. The resulting rich dataset also provides a testbed  for comparing alternative specifications of the statistical model for  analysing dictator game data. It shows how Tobit models (assuming that  dictators would even want to take money) and hurdle models (assuming  that the decision to give a positive amount is separate from the choice  of amount, conditional on giving) provide additional insights.","718":"Homo economicus,  a model for humans in neoclassical economics, is a rational maximizer  of self-interest. However, many social scientists regard such a person  as a mere imaginary creature. We found that 31 of 446 residents of  relatively wealthy Tokyo suburbs met the behavioral definition of Homo economicus.  In several rounds of economic games, participants whose behavior was  consistent with this model always apportioned the money endowed by the  experimenter to themselves, leaving no share for their partners. These  participants had high IQs and a deliberative decision style. An  additional 39 participants showed a similar disregard for other people\u2019s  welfare, although they were slightly more altruistic than those in the Homo economicus group. The psychological composition of these quasi\u2013Homo economicus participants was distinct from that of participants in the Homo economicus  group. Although participants in the latter group behaved selfishly on  the basis of rational calculations, those in the former group made  selfish choices impulsively. The implications of these findings  concerning the two types of extreme noncooperators are discussed.","719":"Highlights\u2022Personality trait agreeableness is related to cooperation in finitely repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma.\u2022Effect of agreeableness on cooperation is robust to inclusion of controls including cognitive ability.\u2022One standard deviation increase in agreeableness raises chance of cooperation by 15% points.AbstractWe  investigate the role personality plays in Finitely Repeated Prisoner\u2019s  Dilemma (FRPD) games. Even after controlling for demographic factors  such as race, course of study, and cognitive ability, we find that  cooperative behavior is significantly related to the Big Five  personality trait Agreeableness. A one standard deviation increase in  agreeableness increases the predicted probability of cooperation by a  subject with modal demographic characteristics from 67.9% to 80.6%.","720":"In  the standard one-shot Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game, participants often  choose to cooperate, when the optimal strategy is to defect. This  puzzling finding has attracted considerable interest both in terms of  possible computational frameworks for modeling human judgment, but also  regarding the more general debate of human altruism. In this research,  we ask how much of human behavior in this task can be explained by a  putative bias for cooperative behavior and whether this, in turn, is  influenced by personality. We compared performance on the standard task  with performance on a matched neutral one; we manipulated the optimal  strategy (defect or cooperate); and we manipulated the amount of payoff  for responding optimally. Results revealed little evidence for a bias  for cooperative behavior, but significant associations with the  personality factors of Behavioural Activation System (BAS) Reward  Responsivity and Agreeableness were found. These findings are discussed  in terms of the attempt to explain judgment in one-shot, Prisoner\u2019s  Dilemma tasks with statistical or probabilistic models.","721":"A  novelty of the new Paris Agreement is the inclusion of a process for  assessment and review of countries\u2019 nationally determined pledges and  contributions. The intent is to reveal whether similar countries are  making comparable pledges, whether the totality of such pledges will  achieve the global goal, and whether, over the coming years, the  contributions actually made by countries will equal or exceed their  pledges. The intent is also to provide an opportunity for countries to  express their approval, or disapproval, of the pledges and contributions  made by individual countries. Here we report the results of a lab  experiment on the effects of such a process in a game in which players  choose a group target, declare their individual pledges, and then make  voluntary contributions to supply a public good. Our results show that a  review process is more likely to affect targets and pledges than actual  contributions. Even when a review process increases average  contributions, the effect is relatively small. As the window for  achieving the 2\u00a0\u00b0C goal will close soon, our results suggest that,  rather than merely implement the Paris Agreement, negotiators should  begin now to develop complementary approaches to limiting emissions,  including the adoption of agreements that are designed differently than  the one adopted in Paris.","722":"Many  natural systems involve thresholds that, once triggered, imply  irreversible damages for the users. Although the existence of such  thresholds is undisputed, their location is highly uncertain. We explore  experimentally how threshold uncertainty affects collective action in a  series of threshold public goods games. Whereas the public good is  always provided when the exact value of the threshold is known,  threshold uncertainty is generally detrimental for the public good  provision as contributions become more erratic. The negative effect of  threshold uncertainty is particularly severe when it takes the form of  ambiguity, i.e. when players are not only unaware of the value of the  threshold, but also of its probability distribution. Early and credible  commitment helps groups to cope with uncertainty.","723":"Prior  studies have shown that selfish behavior is reduced when co-players  have the opportunity to approve\/disapprove a player\u2019s choice, even if  that has no consequences on the player\u2019s material payoff.

Our data is consistent with a model based on the assumption that  people feel badly if they expect to be disapproved by others.  Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence in line with the following  assumptions: (i) people become more aware about the other\u2019s opinion if  feedback is available, and (ii) even if the feedback is ex post and has  no effect on their ex ante expectations about disapproval, people prefer  not to receive negative feedback.","724":"nan","725":"in some important multiplayer situations, such as efforts to supply a global public good, players canchoosethegametheywanttoplay.inthispaperweconductanexperimentaltestofthedecisionbyagroupwith\ufb01xedmembership,playingovera\ufb01nitenumberofperiods,tochoosebetweena\u201ctipping\u201dgame, in which every player wants to contribute to the public good provided enough other playerscontribute, and a prisoners\u2019 dilemma, the classic cooperation game. in the prisoners\u2019 dilemma, the\ufb01rst best outcome is attainable, but cannot be sustained as a nash equilibrium. in the tipping game,only a second best outcome may be attainable, but there exists a nash equilibrium that is strictlypreferred to the one in the prisoners\u2019 dilemma. we show that many groups persistently choose theprisoners\u2019 dilemma despite its strategic disadvantage, and that the groups that eventually choosethe tipping game do better than the ones that stick with the prisoners\u2019 dilemma.

We also show that the  effect of oxytocin on trust is not due to a general increase in the  readiness to bear risks. On the contrary, oxytocin specifically affects  an individual's willingness to accept social risks arising through  interpersonal interactions.

However, very little is known about how brain empathic responses are  modulated by the affective link between individuals.

We engaged male and female volunteers in an economic game, in which two  confederates played fairly or unfairly, and then measured brain  activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while these same  volunteers observed the confederates receiving pain. Both sexes  exhibited empathy-related activation in pain-related brain areas  (fronto-insular and anterior cingulate cortices) towards fair players.  However, these empathy-related responses were significantly reduced in  males when observing an unfair person receiving pain. This effect was  accompanied by increased activation in reward-related areas, correlated  with an expressed desire for revenge. We conclude that in men (at least)  empathic responses are shaped by valuation of other people's social  behaviour, such that they empathize with fair opponents while favouring  the physical punishment of unfair opponents, a finding that echoes  recent evidence for altruistic punishment.","732":"Tasks that engage a theory of mind  seem to activate a consistent set of brain areas.

Upon initial contact, investment choices in  social settings can be inherently risky, as the degree to which the  other person will reciprocate is unknown. Nevertheless, people have been  shown to exhibit prosocial behavior even in one-shot laboratory  settings where all interaction has been taken away. A logical step has  been to link such behavior to trait empathy-related neurobiological  networks. However, as a social interaction unfolds, the degree of  uncertainty with respect to the expected payoff of choice behavior may  change as a function of the interaction. Here we attempt to capture this  factor. We show that the interpersonal tie one develops with another  person during interaction \u2013 rather than trait empathy \u2013 motivates  investment in a public good that is shared with an anonymous interaction  partner. We examined how individual differences in trait empathy and  interpersonal ties modulate neural responses to imposed monetary  sharing. After, but not before interaction in a public good game,  sharing prompted activation of neural systems associated with reward  (striatum), empathy (anterior insular cortex and anterior cingulate  cortex) as well as altruism, and social significance [posterior superior  temporal sulcus (pSTS)]. Although these activations could be linked to  both empathy and interpersonal ties, only tie-related pSTS activation  predicted prosocial behavior during subsequent interaction, suggesting a  neural substrate for keeping track of social relevance.","735":"Economic  behavior often takes place in small groups of people interacting with  each other (like work teams and boards of directors, but also social  networks and neighborhoods).

In this  paper, we investigate experimentally the development of social ties  structures through economic interaction in a public good environment. It  turns out that complicated dynamics arise from individual differences  in social value orientation and affective response patterns.","736":" During behavioral adaptation through interaction with human  and nonhuman agents, marked individual differences are seen in both  real-life situations and games. However, the underlying neural mechanism  is not well understood. We conducted a neuroimaging experiment in which  subjects maximized monetary rewards by learning in a prisoner's dilemma  game with two computer agents: agent A, a tit-for-tat player who  repeats the subject's previous action, and agent B, a simple stochastic  cooperator oblivious to the subject's action. Approximately 1\/3 of the  subjects (group I) learned optimally in relation to both A and B, while  another 1\/3 (group II) did so only for B. Postexperiment interviews  indicated that group I exploited the agent strategies more often than  group II. Significant differences in learning-related brain activity  between the two groups were only found in the superior temporal sulcus  (STS) for both A and B. Furthermore, the learning performance of each  group I subject was predictable based on this STS activity, but not in  the group II subjects. This differential activity could not be  attributed to a behavioral difference since it persisted in relation to  agent B for which the two groups behaved similarly. In sharp contrast,  the brain structures for reward processing were recruited similarly by  both groups. These results suggest that STS provides knowledge of the  other agent's strategies for association between action and reward and  highlights learning competence during interactive reinforcement  learning.","737":"Increased  cooperation in groups that are allowed to communicate (engage in \u201ccheap  talk\u201d) has been attributed to reputation-building and to cultural norms  or culturally normal behavior.

Since the uniqueness of human society  critically depends on the enforcement of norms, the understanding of the  neural circuitry of the impact of parochial altruism on social norm  enforcement is key, but unexplored. To fill this gap, we measured brain  activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while  subjects had the opportunity to punish ingroup members and outgroup  members for violating social norms. Findings revealed that subjects'  strong punishment of defecting outgroup members is associated with  increased activity in a functionally connected network involved in  sanction\u2010related decisions (right orbitofrontal gyrus, right lateral  prefrontal cortex, right dorsal caudatus). Moreover, the stronger the  connectivity in this network, the more outgroup members are punished. In  contrast, the much weaker punishment of ingroup members who committed  the very same norm violation is associated with increased activity and  connectivity in the mentalizing\u2010network (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex,  bilateral temporo\u2010parietal junction), as if subjects tried to understand  or justify ingroup members' behavior. Finally, connectivity analyses  between the two networks suggest that the mentalizing\u2010network modulates  punishment by affecting the activity in the right orbitofrontal gyrus  and right lateral prefrontal cortex, notably in the same areas showing  enhanced activity and connectivity whenever third\u2010parties strongly  punished defecting outgroup members.

Unreciprocated cooperation was associated with greater  activity in bilateral anterior insula, left hippocampus and left lingual  gyrus, compared with reciprocated cooperation. These areas were also  more responsive to unreciprocated cooperation than to unsuccessful risk  taking in a non-social context. Finally, functional connectivity between  anterior insula and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in response to  unreciprocated cooperation predicted subsequent defection.

Here, we exploit a seminal set of laboratory experiments that  originally showed that voluntary costly punishment can help sustain  cooperation. In these experiments, subjects were randomly assigned to a  sequence of different groups to play a series of single-shot public  goods games with strangers; this feature allowed us to draw networks of  interactions to explore how cooperative and uncooperative behaviors  spread from person to person to person.

Prominent among the  several mechanisms proposed to explain how cooperation can emerge is the  existence of a population structure that determines the interactions  among individuals. Many models have explored analytically and by  simulation the effects of such a structure, particularly in the  framework of the Prisoner's Dilemma, but the results of these models  largely depend on details such as the type of spatial structure or the  evolutionary dynamics. Therefore, experimental work suitably designed to  address this question is needed to probe these issues.   Methods and Findings We  have designed an experiment to test the emergence of cooperation when  humans play Prisoner's Dilemma on a network whose size is comparable to  that of simulations. We find that the cooperation level declines to an  asymptotic state with low but nonzero cooperation. Regarding players'  behavior, we observe that the population is heterogeneous, consisting of  a high percentage of defectors, a smaller one of cooperators, and a  large group that shares features of the conditional cooperators of  public goods games. We propose an agent-based model based on the  coexistence of these different strategies that is in good agreement with  all the experimental observations.   Conclusions In  our large experimental setup, cooperation was not promoted by the  existence of a lattice beyond a residual level (around 20%) typical of  public goods experiments. Our findings also indicate that both  heterogeneity and a \u201cmoody\u201d conditional cooperation strategy, in which  the probability of cooperating also depends on the player's previous  action, are required to understand the outcome of the experiment. These  results could impact the way game theory on graphs is used to model  human interactions in structured groups.  ","766":"The  presence of costly cooperation between otherwise selfish actors is not  trivial. A prominent mechanism that promotes cooperation is spatial  population structure. However, recent experiments with human subjects  report substantially lower level of cooperation then predicted by  theoretical models. We analyze the data of such an experiment in which a  total of 400 players play a Prisoner's Dilemma on a   square lattice in two treatments, either interacting via a fixed square  lattice (15 independent groups) or with a population structure changing  after each interaction (10 independent groups). We analyze the  statistics of individual decisions and infer in which way they can be  matched with the typical models of evolutionary game theorists. We find  no difference in the strategy updating between the two treatments.

This suggests that the promotion  of cooperation by population structure is not as straightforward in  humans as often envisioned in theoretical models. ","767":"To  find conditions under which humans cooperate within groups of unrelated  individuals has been of major interest in the behavioral sciences. The  experimental paradigm for studying potential cooperation in social  dilemmas is the public goods game. Here humans regularly fail to sustain  a public resource cooperatively. However, the need to maintain good  reputation for other social interactions, such as indirect reciprocity,  has been identified as an effective mechanism to sustain cooperation in  public goods situations. As a side effect of building a good reputation  through cooperative actions, an individual provides direct benefits to  members of his\/her own social group. These benefits could be an  incentive to reward a good reputation of group members. Here we show  experimentally that building a good reputation through cooperative  behavior in a public goods situation is rewarded in future social  interactions, not only within one\u2019s own social group but also, at a  similar level, in other social groups: humans regard cooperative  behavior of others as an honest signal irrespective of past direct  personal benefits. Reputation gained within as well as outside one\u2019s own  social group can be a driving force for selfish individuals to  cooperate in public goods situations, and thereby sustain any public  resource.","768":"In  this paper we study learning and cooperation in repeated prisoners'  dilemmas experiments.

The fight goes back and forth, giving the neighbours a hard  time. These kind of reciprocal punishments are known as vendettas and  they are a cross-cultural phenomenon. In evolutionary biology,  punishment is seen as a mechanism for maintaining cooperative behaviour.  However, this notion of punishment excludes vendettas. Vendettas pose a  special kind of evolutionary problem: they incur high costs on  individuals, i.e. costs of punishing and costs of being punished,  without any benefits. Theoretically speaking, punishment should be rare  in dyadic relationships and vendettas would not evolve under natural  selection. In contrast, punishment is assumed to be more efficient in  group environments which then can pave the way for vendettas.  Accordingly, we found that under the experimental conditions of a  prisoner\u2019s dilemma game, human participants punished only rarely and  vendettas are scarce. In contrast, we found that participants retaliated  frequently in the group environment of a public goods game. They even  engaged in cost-intense vendettas (i.e. continuous retaliation),  especially when the first punishment was unjustified or ambiguous. Here,  punishment was mainly targeted at defectors in the beginning, but  provocations led to mushrooming of counter-punishments. Despite the  counter-punishing behaviour, participants were able to enhance  cooperation levels in the public goods game. Few participants even  seemed to anticipate the outbreak of costly vendettas and delayed their  punishment to the last possible moment. Overall, our results highlight  the importance of different social environments while studying  punishment as a cooperation-enhancing mechanism.

Within a  linear public good game, we experimentally investigate two possible  factors that impact the decision to cooperate in a smaller, local or a  larger, global group: diverging marginal per capita returns, resulting  in different social returns, and social feedback information. If social  returns are equal across groups, subjects prefer to contribute to the  local group that offers social information on individual contributions.  An increase of the social return in the global group initially attracts  more contributions, but this tendency quickly unravels in favor of  cooperation in the local group. Cooperation in the global public good  can only be sustained if contributions of global group members can be  observed.

In two studies,  participants played a sequential prisoner's dilemma game with cheaters  and cooperative partners. Alternating with the game blocks, participants  were asked to classify the smiling or angry facial expressions of  cooperators and cheaters. Both experiments revealed congruence effects,  reflecting faster identification of the smiles of cooperators  (Experiments 1 and 2) and faster identification of the angry facial  expressions of cheaters (Experiment 2).

Here, we show that human memory  may not meet the requirements needed to use these strategies. When asked  to recall the previous behavior of simulated partners in a cooperative  memory task, participants performed poorly, making errors in 10\u201324% of  the trials. Participants made more errors when required to track more  partners. We conducted agent-based simulations to evaluate how well  cooperative strategies cope with error. These simulations suggest that,  even with few errors, cooperation could not be maintained at the error  rates demonstrated by our participants. Our results indicate that the  strategies typically used in the study of cooperation likely do not  reflect the underlying cognitive capacities used by humans and other  animals in social interactions.

We assigned participants to  one of three interaction groups which differed in the proportion of  computer partners' types (defectors rare, equal proportion, or  cooperators rare). We extended research on both hypotheses in two ways.  First, participants experienced their partners repeatedly by interacting  in Prisoner's Dilemma games. Second, we tested categorization of  partners as cooperators or defectors in memory tests after a short and  long retention interval (10 min and 1 week). Participants remembered  rare partner types better than they remembered common ones at both  retention intervals.

","783":"People  regularly free ride on collective benefits, consuming them without  contributing to their creation. In response, free riders are often  moralized, becoming targets of negative moral judgments, anger,  ostracism, or punishment. Moralization can change free riders\u2019 behavior  (e.g., encouraging them to contribute or discouraging them from taking  future benefits) or it can motivate others, including moralizers, to  avoid or exclude free riders; these effects of moralization are critical  to sustaining human cooperation. Based on theories of error management  and fundamental social domains from evolutionary psychology, we propose  that the decision to moralize is a cue-driven process. One cue  investigated in past work is observing a person illicitly consume  collective benefits. Here, we test whether the mind uses a 2nd cue:  merely opting out of contributing. Use of this cue creates a phenomenon  of preventive moralization: moralization of people who have not yet  exploited collective benefits but who might\u2014or might not\u2014in the future.  We tested for preventive moralization across 9 studies using  implicit and explicit measures of moralization, a behavioral measure of  costly punishment, mediation analyses of the underlying processes, and a  nationally representative sample of almost 1,000 U.S. adults. Results  revealed that merely opting out of contributing to the creation of  exploitable collective benefits\u2014despite not actually exploiting  collective benefits\u2014elicited moralization.

Aggregated over trials, participants spent more money for punishing the defection of likable-looking and smiling partners compared to punishing the defection of unlikable-looking and nonsmiling partners, but only because participants were more likely to cooperate with likable-looking and smiling partners, which provided the participants with more opportunities for moralistic punishment.

Participants interacted with trustworthy-looking and  untrustworthy-looking partners in a sequential Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma Game.  Facial trustworthiness was manipulated to stimulate expectations about  the future behavior of the partners which were either violated or  confirmed by the partners\u2019 cheating or cooperation during the game. In a  source memory test, participants were required to recognize the  partners and to classify them as cheaters or cooperators. A multinomial  model was used to disentangle item memory, source memory and guessing  processes. We found an expectancy-congruent bias toward guessing that  trustworthy-looking partners were more likely to be associated with  cooperation than untrustworthy-looking partners. Source memory was  enhanced for cheating that violated the participants\u2019 positive  expectations about trustworthy-looking partners. We were interested in  whether or not this expectancy-violation effect\u2014that helps to revise  unjustified expectations about trustworthy-looking partners\u2014depends on  cognitive load induced via a secondary continuous reaction time task.  Although this secondary task interfered with working memory processes in  a validation study, both the expectancy-congruent guessing bias as well  as the expectancy-violation effect were obtained with and without  cognitive load. These findings support the hypothesis that the  expectancy-violation effect is due to a simple mechanism that does not  rely on demanding elaborative processes. We conclude that most cognitive  mechanisms underlying social cooperation presumably operate  automatically so that they remain unaffected by cognitive load.","788":": contributions in the public goods game\u2014a classical social dilemma situation\u2014have been shown todepend strongly on the presence versus absence of punishment or sanctions for free riders. also, there appear to benoteworthy individual differences in the degree to which decision makers cooperate. herein, we aimed to bring thesetwo lines of research together. firstly, we predicted that both presence of punishment and high dispositionalhonesty\u2013humility (as conceptualized in the honesty\u2013humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness,conscientiousness, openness to experience model of personality) should yield higher contributions. secondly, andmore importantly, we expected an interaction, such that only those low in honesty\u2013humility would condition theirbehaviour on the presence versus absence of punishment, thus employing cooperation strategically. in line with thehypothesis, the results of two experiments (one of which comprised a longitudinal design) corroborated that thedegree to which decision makers shift towards higher contributions when punishment is introduced depends on theirdispositional level of honesty\u2013humility. copyright \u00a9 2011 john wiley & sons, ltd.","789":"Highlights\u2022Examined outcome evaluation using ERPs after decisions to cooperate or aggress.\u2022dFRN and P300 amplitudes were modulated by the participant's decision strategy.\u2022dFRN suggests that outcome differential between players influences evaluations.\u2022P300 suggests that outcomes of risky decisions or decisions that are favorable are more salient.\u2022Using ERPs with true social dilemma tasks helps to better understand decision-making.AbstractMimicking  real world situations, the Chicken Game allows scientists to examine  human decision-making when the outcome is not entirely within one  person's control.

Using Temperament and  Character Inventory (TCI) scales, the scores on Mach IV test showed a  positive correlation with Novelty Seeking and a negative correlation  with Reward Dependence, Self-Directedness, Cooperativeness, and  Self-Transcendence. We found that the Mach scores negatively correlated  with the players\u2019 contribution over the game, and positively with the  total profit they gained by the end of the game. Regression analyses  revealed that the contribution of high Mach persons (those who had  relatively high scores on Mach scale) to the public good were primarily  influenced by the number of altruists in the group, whereas low Machs\u2019  decisions were influenced more by a temperament factor (Persistence). We  assume that, compared to others, Machiavellians may be more sensitive  to situational factors and take the behavior of their playmates into  account to a greater degree, which may lead to their success in the  exploitation of others.","802":"Game-theoretic  experiments have revealed substantial individual differences where the  game allows for off-equilibrium behavior such as trust and reciprocity.  We explore the personality psychology and decision making literatures  and conclude that these individual differences are likely to be mediated  by differential emotional arousal.

We use that test to  predict the behavior of participants in a two-person one-shot  constituent game in which subjects face a choice between trust and  distrust, and between reciprocation (trustworthiness) and defection. We  find that the Mach-IV scale does not predict trusting behavior. It does,  however, predict reciprocity. Over one half of those who score low to  average on the scale reciprocate trust. High scorers overwhelmingly  defect when it is to their advantage to do so.","803":"This  study is aimed at exploring the decision making processes underlying  the Machiavellians\u2019 exploitation of others in a social dilemma  situation.

More specifically, we predicted  that high-Mach people would show elevated activity in the brain areas  involved in reward-seeking, anticipation of risky situations, and  inference making. To test this hypothesis, we used an fMRI technique to  examine individuals as they played the Trust Game. In accordance with  our predictions, we found consistent activation in high-Machs\u2019 thalamus  and anterior cingulate cortex (player 1), and dorsal anterior  insula\/inferior frontal gyrus (player 2).

Whereas,  much research has addressed the strategic and cognitive mechanisms that  underlie cooperation, investigations into chemosensory processes have  received very limited research attention. To bridge that gap, we build  on recent research that has identified the chemically synthesized  odorant Hedione (HED) as a ligand for the putative human pheromone  receptor (VN1R1) expressed in the olfactory mucosa, and hypothesize that  exposure to HED may increase reciprocity. Applying behavioral economics  paradigms, the present research shows that exposure to the ligand  causes differentiated behavioral effects in reciprocal punishments  (Study 1) as well as rewards (Study 2), two types of behaviors that are  frequently regarded as essential for the development and maintenance of  cooperation.","813":"Cooperation is central to human social behaviour1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  However, choosing to cooperate requires individuals to incur a personal  cost to benefit others. Here we explore the cognitive basis of  cooperative decision-making in humans using a dual-process framework10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.  We ask whether people are predisposed towards selfishness, behaving  cooperatively only through active self-control; or whether they are  intuitively cooperative, with reflection and prospective reasoning  favouring \u2018rational\u2019 self-interest. To investigate this issue, we  perform ten studies using economic games. We find that across a range of  experimental designs, subjects who reach their decisions more quickly  are more cooperative. Furthermore, forcing subjects to decide quickly  increases contributions, whereas instructing them to reflect and forcing  them to decide slowly decreases contributions. Finally, an induction  that primes subjects to trust their intuitions increases contributions  compared with an induction that promotes greater reflection. To explain  these results, we propose that cooperation is intuitive because  cooperative heuristics are developed in daily life where cooperation is  typically advantageous. We then validate predictions generated by this  proposed mechanism. Our results provide convergent evidence that  intuition supports cooperation in social dilemmas, and that reflection  can undermine these cooperative impulses.","814":"When  people have the chance to help others at a cost to themselves, are  cooperative decisions driven by intuition or reflection? To answer this  question, recent studies have tested the relationship between reaction  times (RTs) and cooperation, reporting both positive and negative  correlations. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, we argue that  decision conflict (rather than the use of intuition vs. reflection)  drives response times, leading to an inverted-U shaped relationship  between RT and cooperation. Studies 1 through 3 show that intermediate  decisions take longer than both extremely selfish and extremely  cooperative decisions. Studies 4 and 5 find that the conflict between  self-interested and cooperative motives explains individual differences  in RTs. Manipulating conflictedness causes longer RTs and more  intermediate decisions, and RTs mediate the relationship between  conflict and intermediate decisions. Finally, Studies 6 and 7  demonstrate that conflict is distinct from reflection by manipulating  the use of intuition (vs. reflection). Experimentally promoting reliance  on intuition increases cooperation, but has no effects on decision  extremity or feelings of conflictedness. In sum, we provide evidence  that RTs should not be interpreted as a direct proxy for the use of  intuitive or reflective processes, and dissociate the effects of  conflict and reflection in social decision making.

Here, we show that perceived  similarity substantially increases altruistic punishment, a key  mechanism underlying human cooperation. We induced (dis)similarity  perception by manipulating basic cognitive mechanisms in an economic  cooperation game that included a punishment phase. We found that  similarity-focused participants were more willing to punish others\u2019  uncooperative behavior. This influence of similarity is not explained by  group identity, which has the opposite effect on altruistic punishment.  Our findings demonstrate that pure similarity promotes reciprocity in  ways known to encourage cooperation. At the same time, the increased  willingness to punish norm violations among similarity-focused  participants provides a rationale for why similar people are more likely  to build stable social relationships. Finally, our findings show that  altruistic punishment is differentially involved in encouraging  cooperation under pure similarity vs. in-group conditions.","816":"In  the recent literature, several hypotheses have been offered to explain  patterns of human behavior in social environments.

As hypothesized, subjects whose penalties had been  reciprocated with equal retaliation were more cooperative on the first  block of promise trials than were 20\u2010point or five\u2010point subjects, but  this effect dissipated, presumably because the opponent was not  programed to reciprocate with a competitive choice if the promised  cooperation was exploited.

In asymmetric environments, one team has a greater probability of  winning given the same contribution level (unfair contests) or has a  lower cost of contributing (uneven contests). We explore how such  asymmetries impact behavior, asking how being advantaged or  disadvantaged influences contributions. We find both advantaged and  disadvantaged teams contribute much more than theory predicts, but in  such a way that ex-post winning probabilities of the contests are  consistent with theoretical predictions. At the individual level,  contributions are predicted by beliefs about own team and opponent team  contributions. The determinants of contribution by members of the  disadvantaged team differ depending on the nature of asymmetry.  Contributions by the disadvantaged team members are responsive to  beliefs about contribution by opponents in unfair contests while in  uneven contests they are responsive to beliefs about the contribution by  teammates.","844":"  Abstract  A fundamental problem in organizations is designing  mechanisms for eliciting voluntary contributions from individual members  of a team who are entrapped in a social dilemma.

In equilibrium, such competition enhances  the incentive to contribute, thereby reducing  free\u2010riding.

Comparing two protocols for sharing the prize\u2014egalitarian and  proportional profit\u2010sharing rules\u2014we find that (i) free\u2010riding  diminishes and (ii) team members contribute more toward their team's  effort when they belong to the larger team and when the profit\u2010sharing  rule is proportional.

However, if beliefs and preferences interact,  this may have implications for the interpretation of observed behavior.  Our sequential social dilemma experiment allows us to separate different  interaction channels. When subjects play both roles in such  experiments, a positive correlation between first- and second-mover  behavior is frequently reported. We find that the observed correlation  primarily originates via an indirect channel, where second-mover  decisions influence beliefs through a consensus effect, and the  first-mover decision is a best response to these beliefs. Specifically,  beliefs about second-mover cooperation are biased toward own  second-mover behavior, and most subjects best respond to stated beliefs.  However, we also find evidence for a direct, preference-based channel.  When first movers know the true probability of second-mover cooperation,  subjects' own second moves still have predictive power regarding their  first moves.","869":"We  report experimental results on the effect of leadership in a voluntary  contribution game.

There is, however, an  interesting asymmetry in responses by two subgroups. Subjects who are  pessimistic regarding total group cooperation decrease cooperation the  higher the magnitude of the probabilistic loss and their decisions are  tied systematically to changes in their expectations of other\u2019s  cooperation.

Parallel to the literature on  public goods provision, individual appropriation decreases with the  marginal damage to the group that occurs through appropriation and  increases in the private benefit from appropriation. In addition, we  examine a novel set of decision situations where individual benefits and  group damages change proportionately, as to hold the marginal per  capita return constant. Individual responses to these proportionate  changes are heterogeneous but on average, appropriation levels do not  change significantly. These results are robust to two experimental  designs, a one-shot menu-design where subjects make multiple choices and  a complementary set of sessions where participants make a single  decision in a one-shot game.","874":"In  many cases individuals benefit differently from the provision of a  public good.

We find that, on average,  heterogeneity in returns decreases unconditional contributions but  affects contributions only weakly. Uncertainty in addition to  heterogeneity reduces conditional contributions slightly. Individual  reactions to heterogeneity differ systematically. Selfish subjects and  one third of conditional cooperators do not react to heterogeneity  whereas the reactions of the remaining conditional cooperators vary. A  substantial part of heterogeneity in reactions can be explained by  inequity aversion with respect to different reference groups.","875":"In  public-good provision, privileged groups enjoy the advantage that some  of their members find it optimal to supply a positive amount of the  public good. However, the inherent asymmetric nature of these groups may  make the enforcement of cooperative behavior through informal  sanctioning harder to accomplish. In this article, the authors  experimentally investigate public-good provision in normal and  privileged groups with and without decentralized punishment. The authors  find that compared to normal groups, privileged groups are relatively  ineffective in using costly sanctions to increase everyone's  contributions. Punishment is less targeted toward strong free riders,  and they exhibit a weaker increase in contributions after being  punished.

Monetary versions of these games involve two players  splitting an arbitrary sum of money. In real life, however, people\u2019s  propensity to engage in cooperative behavior depends on their effort and  contribution; factors that are well known to affect perceptions of  fairness. We therefore sought to explore the impact of relative monetary  contributions by players in the UG and PD. Adapted computerized UG and  PD games, in which relative contributions from each player were  manipulated, were administered to 200 participants aged 18\u201350 years old  (50% female). We found that players\u2019 contribution had large effects on  cooperative behavior. Specifically, cooperation was greater amongst  participants when their opponent had contributed more to joint earnings.  This was manifested as higher acceptance rates and higher offers in the  UG; and fewer defects in the PD compared to when the participant  contributed more. Interestingly, equal contributions elicited the  greatest sensitivity to fairness in the UG, and least frequent defection  in the PD. Acceptance rates correlated positively with anxiety and sex  differences were found in defection behavior. This study highlights the  feasibility of computerized games to assess cooperative behavior and the  importance of considering cooperation within the context of effortful  contribution.","877":"The  strong reciprocity model of the evolution of human cooperation has  gained some acceptance, partly on the basis of support from experimental  findings. The observation that unfair offers in the ultimatum game are  frequently rejected constitutes an important piece of the experimental  evidence for strong reciprocity. In the present study, we have  challenged the idea that the rejection response in the ultimatum game  provides evidence of the assumption held by strong reciprocity theorists  that negative reciprocity observed in the ultimatum game is inseparably  related to positive reciprocity as the two sides of a preference for  fairness. The prediction of an inseparable relationship between positive  and negative reciprocity was rejected on the basis of the results of a  series of experiments that we conducted using the ultimatum game, the  dictator game, the trust game, and the prisoner\u2019s dilemma game. We did  not find any correlation between the participants\u2019 tendencies to reject  unfair offers in the ultimatum game and their tendencies to exhibit  various prosocial behaviors in the other games, including their  inclinations to positively reciprocate in the trust game. The  participants\u2019 responses to postexperimental questions add support to the  view that the rejection of unfair offers in the ultimatum game is a  tacit strategy for avoiding the imposition of an inferior status.","878":"BackgroundDeficits  in pro-social cooperation are common in many individuals with mental  illnesses such as depression. For decades, researchers have used  economic game paradigms to compare cross-cultural cooperative behavior.  However, research using economic games to assess cooperative behavior in  clinical populations is in the early stages. We hypothesized that  individuals with greater depressive symptoms would struggle to maintain  reciprocity in iterative games, but not in single-iteration games  measuring personal values.MethodsParticipants (n=41)  played four computer-based economic games (prisoner's dilemma, the  public goods game, the ultimatum game, and the trust game) measuring  different aspects of cooperation. Participants completed the Depression  Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and other measures of personality and  demographics. Analyses assessed the relationships between game  performance and psychological distress as measured by the DASS.ResultsSignificant  correlations were found between game performance and depressive  symptoms, but not symptoms of anxiety or stress. Performance in the  prisoner's dilemma and public goods game was significantly related to  depression in a linear regression even when known associations with  depressive affect such as age, gender, race, education, marital status,  and neuroticism were controlled for.ConclusionsDepressive  symptoms were associated with an inability to sustain reciprocal  cooperation.

While existing theoretical models on the  voluntary provision of public goods usually focus exclusively on single  motivations for individual contributions, we explicitly account for  various motivations in a unified framework, drawing on theories for  public good provision such as pure and impure altruism, internalized  norms and social approval. Such an approach is particularly useful when  individual offset behavior is heterogeneous. The applicability of our  theoretical framework is supported by data from a choice experiment on  voluntary carbon offsetting in Switzerland and the USA. We find that  willingness to pay for offsets mainly depends on an individual's  internalized norms to avoid environmental degradation as well as partly  on income. The probability to offset, instead, is better explained by an  individual's expected social recognition for offsetting.","880":"Prosocial  behavior is crucial for functioning societies. However, its reliable  scientific assessment and the understanding of its underlying structure  are still a challenge. We integrated 14 paradigms from diverse  disciplines to identify reliable and method-independent subcomponents of  human prosociality; 329 participants performed game theoretical  paradigms and hypothetical distribution tasks commonly used in  behavioral economics and completed interactive computer tasks and  self-reports typically employed in psychology. Four subcomponents of  prosociality were identified by exploratory factor analysis and verified  by confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample:  altruistically motivated prosocial behavior, norm motivated prosocial  behavior, strategically motivated prosocial behavior, and self-reported  prosocial behavior. Altruistically motivated behavior was related to  gender, to enhanced cognitive skills, and to reduced negative affect.  Our study provides a crucial step toward an overarching framework on  prosocial behavior that will benefit future research on predictors,  neural underpinnings, and plasticity of human cooperation and  prosociality.","881":"Highlights\u2022We manipulate outcome valence and externality valence framing in public goods.\u2022We find an interaction effect of positive outcome and negative externality framing.\u2022Cooperation increases by 45\u201363% due to this framing effect.\u2022The framing effect on cooperation is replicated in an applied vignette study.AbstractThe  aim of this paper is to examine how framing influences people\u2019 s  cooperation behavior in social dilemmas. In Experiment 1 we investigated  the influence of outcome valence (positive vs. negative outcome) and  externality valence (positive vs. negative externality) framing on  players\u2019 willingness to cooperate in a repeated public good game. We  found a significant interaction effect on first-round cooperation,  indicating larger cooperation rates when there is a negative outcome  valence and a positive externality on others. Furthermore, this effect  remained largely stable when comparing cooperation over all rounds,  resulting in 45\u201363% increased cooperation compared to the other  conditions. In Experiment 2 we replicated the effect in an applied  vignette study, lending support for the generalizability of this framing  effect. Taken together, these findings suggest that public goods  provisions may be increased substantially by framing the situation\u2019s  outcome valence as negative rather than positive.","882":"The  hypothesis, that injunctive and descriptive norms interact positively  or synergistically to promote cooperation in social dilemmas, is tested  in the context of a survey study focusing on environmentally responsible  behaviour.

By using structural equation modelling with  residual centering, these problems are overcome and the interaction  hypothesis is confirmed. The result is stable across three replications  spanning a two-year period.","883":"Highlights\u2022I compare contribute vs. take and gain vs. loss framing in public goods games.\u2022Take framing decreases cooperation, while loss framing has little effect.\u2022Men are more responsive to framing than women in this context.AbstractI  examine two dimensions of framing in public goods games: Contributing  vs. Taking and Gains vs. Losses. I find decreased cooperation under the  Taking frame, but not under the Loss frame. This framing effect is  stronger for men than women.","884":"In  an experimental study, we investigated how decisions in social dilemmas  are affected by the valence of outcomes that are at stake. Prospect  theory states that individuals are risk-averse when outcomes are framed  as gains, and risk-seeking when outcomes are framed as losses. On the  basis of this framework, previous research on social dilemmas has  addressed the question of whether people are more cooperative in the  negative domain than in the positive domain, but this research has led  to inconsistent results. A possible explanation for this is that in many  social dilemmas it is unclear whether cooperation or defection is the  risky choice. In the current paper, we compare the well-studied  prisoner\u2019s dilemma with the less studied chicken game. Whereas in the  prisoner\u2019s dilemma it is unclear what constitutes the risky option, in  the chicken game the risky option is quite clear. Consistent with  predictions, we found in the chicken game more defection in the loss  frame than in the gain frame, but no difference between the gain and  loss frame in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma. Moreover, choices were predicted  by risk attitude in the chicken game, but not in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma.","885":" We study framing effects in repeated social dilemmas by comparing  payoff-equivalent Give- and Take-framed public goods games under varying  matching mechanisms (Partners or Strangers) and levels of feedback  (Aggregate or Individual).

The results show Take framing and Individual-level  feedback lead to more extreme behavior (free-riding and full  cooperation), especially for Partners. These results suggest Take  framing and Individual-level feedback increase the variability of  cooperation.

Stated differently, the  experiment examined the conditions required to make an aggregate of  three individuals separately interact with another aggregate of three  individuals in the competitive manner characteristic of the way in which  a group of three individuals has been observed to interact with another  group of three individuals. Interactions occurred between two  aggregates of three individuals via 10 versions of a PDG matrix. In four  of the five conditions each subject in one aggregate interacted with a  single subject from the \u201copposing\u201d aggregate. In the first, or  interdependence, condition the three individuals in each aggregate were  placed in separate rooms, although they did share their earnings. In the  second, or contact, condition the three individuals were placed in the  same room but not allowed to talk to each other. In the third, or  discussion, condition the three individuals were required to discuss  their separate PDG choices with each other. In the fourth, or consensus,  condition the subjects were required to reach consensus regarding their  separate PDG choices. In the fifth, or group-all, condition the  subjects in each aggregate collectively interacted with the subjects in  the opposing aggregate. The results indicated that the group-all and  consensus conditions produced equivalently lower amounts of  cooperativeness than the interdependence, contact, and discussion  conditions.

Can we  thus improve the suboptimal level of voluntary provisions of public  goods? The result is that, on average, all players are better off than  in the standard PG game.

A challenging  question is how different incentive schemes and their actual choice by  the leader shape the team\u2019s culture and contribute to the team\u2019s  success. To shed light on this issue we investigate how a leader chooses  between rewards or punishment in an experimental team setting and how  teammates\u2019 contributions are influenced by this choice. Leaders show a  clear initial preference for rewards, which diminishes over time in some  teams. Leaders who observe more free-riders in their teams tend to  switch to punishment incentives. A change from rewards to negative  incentives results in an immediate and enduring increase in  contributions. On the other hand, contributions show a decreasing trend  in teams with a leader who sticks to rewards.","889":"The  article analyses experimental \u201csolidarity games\u201d with two benefactors  and one beneficiary.

If motives interact, or if envy is a  concern, then more complex (unimodal) shapes may emerge. Controlling  for random utility perturbations, we determine which and how many  motives affect individual decision making. The main findings are that  the motives of about 75% of the subjects can be identified fairly  sharply, that all of the motives discussed in the literature co-exist in  the population, and that for any given individual no more than two  motives (out of six motives considered overall) are identified.

Our analysis centers on the degree to which  subjects deviate from the maximization of their pecuniary rewards, as a  response to others' actions.

","895":"In  many two-player games, players that invest in punishment finish with  lower payoffs than those who abstain from punishing. These results  question the effectiveness of punishment at promoting cooperation,  especially when retaliation is possible. It has been suggested that  these findings may stem from the unrealistic assumption that all players  are equal in terms of power. However, a previous empirical study which  incorporated power asymmetries into an iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD)  game failed to show that power asymmetries stabilize cooperation when  punishment is possible. Instead, players cooperated in response to their  partner cooperating, and punishment did not yield any additional  increase in tendency to cooperate. Nevertheless, this previous study  only allowed an all-or-nothing\u2013rather than a variable\u2013cooperation  investment. It is possible that power asymmetries increase the  effectiveness of punishment from strong players only when players are  able to vary their investment in cooperation. We tested this hypothesis  using a modified IPD game which allowed players to vary their investment  in cooperation in response to being punished. As in the previous study,  punishment from strong players did not increase cooperation under any  circumstances. Thus, in two-player games with symmetric strategy sets,  punishment does not appear to increase cooperation. ","896":"Social  control and the enforcement of social norms glue a society together. It  has been shown theoretically and empirically that informal punishment  of wrongdoers fosters cooperation in human groups. Most of this research  has focused on voluntary and uncoordinated punishment carried out by  individual group members. However, as punishment is costly, it is an  open question as to why humans engage in the punishment of wrongdoers  even in one-time-only encounters. While evolved punitive preferences  have been advocated as proximate explanations for such behaviour, the  strategic nature of the punishment situation has remained underexplored.  It has been suggested to conceive of the punishment situation as a  volunteer's dilemma (VOD), where only one individual's action is  necessary and sufficient to punish the wrongdoer. Here, we show  experimentally that implementing the punishment situation as a VOD  sustains cooperation in an environment where punishers and non-punishers  coexist. Moreover, we show that punishment-cost heterogeneity allows  individuals to tacitly agree on only the strongest group member carrying  out the punishment, thereby increasing the effectiveness and efficiency  of social norm enforcement. Our results corroborate that costly peer  punishment can be explained without assuming punitive preferences and  show that centralized sanctioning institutions can emerge from arbitrary  individual differences.","897":"We  use the voluntary contribution mechanism to investigate whether smaller  action sets lead to higher cooperation rates.

Each sequence was characterized by successive increments  or decrements in either the reward, the punishment, or both of these  parameters. These parameter changes were made to be contingent upon the  responses of the players. The most interesting results obtained in this study relate  to the effects of changes in the punishment parameter of the Prisoner's  Dilemma game.

The simulated target employed one  of four patterns of responding to the threat: open defiance, in which  the target both verbally and behaviorally defied the threats; concealed  defiance, in which the target either refused to reveal his intentions or  lied to the source, but was behaviorally defiant; and open and  concealed compliance conditions similarly defined. The results indicated  that prior announcement of intentions by the target deterred the source  from using the threat in the open defiance condition and \u201cconverted\u201d  him to a mutual cooperator in the open compliance condition. The  concealed conditions, however, encouraged exploitative play by the  subjects; this finding was interpreted by a cost analysis.

Occasional threats of a loss of points  were sent by a simulated player during 150 PDG trials. Unanticipated  effects of both matrices and punishment magnitude were obtained on  overall cooperation. An effect of matrices was obtained on compliance to  threats. Postimpressions of the simulated source were that the 10%  credible threatener was perceived as strongly potent, while the highly  credible source was considered mildly impotent.","904":"Although  the Prisoner's Dilemma game has been widely investigated, few studies  have explored what happens when the doors to the prison are unlocked.  Conventional game-theoretic analysis predicts greater cooperation in  ongoing relationships than with occasional partners. This suggests that  an option to exit decreases cooperation by reducing players' dependence  on each other for help in the future. An alternative hypothesis is that  cooperation increases with selectivity-that is, with the ability to play  with a desired partner. This suggests that an exit option increases  cooperation. We tested both hypotheses in laboratory experiments with  human subjects, using \"Trump,\" a new card-game representation of a  Prisoner's Dilemma. In the first experiment, the exit option reduced  dependence and increased selectivity, relative to a no-exit condition.  We found that selectivity and dependence both increased cooperation, but  for different reasons and with different players, leaving overall  cooperation rates unchanged by an option to exit. In a second  experiment, the exit option increased selectivity but not dependence,  relative to a forced-exit condition. Here we observed higher cooperation  with an option to exit, but only for subjects playing defensive  strategies.","905":"The  joint effect on helping behavior of liking and dependence on another  for future rewards was examined. It was hypothesized that future  dependence produces more helping behavior between people who like one  another than between people who dislike one another. This hypothesis was  derived from the Pruitt and Kimmel (1977) goal\/expectation theory, a  theory developed to interpret certain findings about cooperation in the  prisoner's dilemma game. The hypothesis was supported. For people who  liked one another, future dependence led to more time spent helping and a  greater amount of help than no future dependence. For people who  disliked one another, helping was low regardless of the extent of future  dependence. In addition, the amount of help given the other increased  across trials only for those subjects who were dependent on the other  for later help. The Pruitt and Kimmel theory explains the low level of  helping in the conditions where the other was disliked as due to a lack  of trust that the other would reciprocate.","906":"nan","907":"Previous research reported inconclusive and even contradictory findings on the relationship between locus of control  and cooperative behaviour. In the present paper we argue that this is  because there is no reason to expect that internals are more cooperative  than externals, or vice versa. Going back to the very definition of the  locus of control concept, we hypothesise that internals are likely to  use both cooperative and competitive behaviour  strategically to further their own self-interest. In order to test this  hypothesis 39 subjects played three repeated prisoners dilemma games.  Their locus of control was measured by means of Rotters I\u2013E Locus of  Control scale [Rotter, J.B. (1966). Generalized expectancies for  internal versus external control of reinforcement. Psychological Monographs: General and Applied, 80,  609 pp.]. Our empirical findings indeed reveal that internals seem to  have the adaptive capacity to instrumentally switch from cooperative to  competitive behaviour and vice versa, in a prisoners dilemma game. They  also behave more opportunistically when the risk of retaliation is low.  The results also make clear that it is essential to study cooperative  behaviour dynamically.","908":"In  this article we introduce a new experimental game called Prisoner\u2019s  Dilemma with Variable Dependence (PD\/D), which allows players to  separate their trust in their exchange partners from their cooperation  with them in an ongoing relationship. The game allows researchers to  observe the emergence of trust and cooperation separately, and ascertain  the causal relationship between them. In six studies that use the PD\/D  design, we find that the players of PD\/D consistently achieve very high  cooperation rates, sometimes mean cooperation rates of about 95%, which  are higher than in standard PD games sharing similar design features.  These findings demonstrate that separating trust from cooperation is  critical for building trust relations. They also show that the GRIT  (Graduated Reciprocation In Tension reduction) strategy helps build such  relations in the absence of mutual trust. Our results suggest that it  is cooperation which leads to trust, not the other way around.","909":"  Abstract  An experiment is reported that examines the effects of  emotional mood and evaluative priming on cooperation in a social dilemma  game. Unlike an associative\u2010network account or an equity account of  mood\u2010dependent prosocial behaviour. The present approach assumes that  the primary effect of elated mood is to increase behavioural variability  rather than altruism or cooperation per se. Accordingly, a positively  emotional state serves the function of freeing the individual from the  need to optimize local profits and increasing the range of behavioural  judgments and decisions. As a consequence, positive mood may sometimes  produce a secondary increase of prosocial behaviour (especially when the  normal behaviour is rigidly competitive) but positive mood may at other  times lead to antisocial tendencies and transgression. The empirical  findings are consistent with such an interpretation. Cooperation in a  four\u2010person dilemma game increases when positive connotations of  cooperation andnegative connotations of competition are primed in a  preceding verbal learning task. However, the mood manipulation does not  directly affect the decision to cooperate but only indirectly via  increased variability. In fact, subjects in good mood make more  cooperative as well as more competitive choices than people in bad mood.  The notable priming effect does not support the pessimistic view that  the cooperation is largely determined by crystallized personality  factors.

Groups  high in cohesion but low in respect were more likely to escalate their  commitment to a losing course of action in an escalation dilemma  compared to other groups. There appear to be two distinct types of group  identity: one based on cohesion and the other based on respect.  Cohesion-based identity remained high and relatively constant across the  two tasks among groups of friends, but declined over time among groups  of nonfriends.

In this game, each player\u2019s payoff depends only on  his own contribution and the contributions of his immediate neighbors in  a circle network. As in the standard public goods game, we find  substantial heterogeneity in behavior across subjects, including both  unconditional free-riding and full cooperation, as well as conditional  cooperation. We first examine the impact of different information  conditions on conditional cooperation. At the aggregate level, we find  that players who observe average payoff information about others  contribute significantly less than those who observe average  contribution information. We then investigate the extent to which  conditional cooperators facilitate the spread of cooperation and  free-riding behavior across the network. In groups with a single  free-rider type, we show that individual contributions decay faster for  players who are closer in the network to the free rider. On the other  hand, in groups with a single unconditional full contributor type,  players do not respond by converging to full cooperation. Instead, we  find that proximity to the unconditional full contributor seems only to  mitigate (or delay) the typical decline in contributions over time.  These contrasting effects are consistent with the widespread claim that  conditional cooperation is imperfect, or exhibits a self-serving bias.","912":"Previous  research demonstrates that individuals vary in their social  preferences.

In addition, we observe that network  configurations are more important than punishment capacities for the  levels of public good provision, imposed sanctions and economic  efficiency. Lastly, we show that targeted revenge is a major driver of  anti-social punishment.","914":"Highlights\u2022We test how different information regimes affect the willingness to cooperate of `conditional cooperators\u2019.\u2022Cooperation is higher when individual rather than average information is provided.\u2022This effect is particularly strong when others\u2019 contributions are relatively uniform.\u2022On average, contributions are lower the higher the variation in others' contributions.\u2022Conditional cooperators are more likely to follow a low rather than high contributor.AbstractWe  experimentally investigate how different information about others\u2019  individual contributions affects conditional cooperators\u2019 willingness to  cooperate in a one-shot linear public goods game. We find that when  information about individual contributions is provided, contributions  are generally higher than when only average information is available.  This effect is particularly strong when others\u2019 individual contributions  are relatively homogeneous. When both types of information are  provided, this effect is moderated. In the case of individual feedback  we find the willingness to contribute to be higher the lower the  variation in others' contributions, but with pronounced heterogeneity in  individuals\u2019 reactions. While the majority of conditional cooperators\u2019  are mainly guided by others\u2019 average contributions, more people follow  the bad example of a low contributor than the good example of a high  contributor.

In these games, we use an  exogenous network to restrict both monitoring and the set of feasible  punishment flows. In addition to two baseline structures (the Complete  network and the Circle network), we examine a novel Asymmetric network  in which both punishment responsibility and exposure differ across  players. Average contributions are significantly lower in the Asymmetric  network, driven entirely by the under-monitored player who faces only  one potential punisher. We formulate and examine the hypothesis that  asymmetry among a player's potential punishment targets may lead to  discriminatory patterns of punishment. In particular, players might wish  to punish targets for whom they are solely responsible discriminately  more than targets for whom they share responsibility. The experimental  data do not support this hypothesis, although they do suggest a  compelling explanation as to why. Specifically, we find that the  under-monitored player in the network retaliates against previous  punishment significantly more often than others in the group, which  deters their only potential punisher from issuing stronger sanctions.  Thus, an additional complication of asymmetry in the network is that it  may lead to more instances of anti-social retaliation, inhibiting the  effectiveness of the decentralized punishment institution.","916":"  Abstract  Thirty\u2010two groups of three subjects each participated once  in an intergroup public goods game (IPG) in which two groups compete for  the provision of step\u2010level public goods. Half of the groups were  allowed to discuss the conflict before their members decided privately  and anonymously whether to contribute their endowments to their group  benefit, and half were not given this opportunity. The results show that  preplay group discussion enhances the percentage of contributors and  changes the players' estimates about the decisions of the other players.  The theoretical implications of the results are examined within the  framework of a new model which relates the individual decision to  contribute or not to the reward structure, altruism, and the  individual's belief structure.

Leadership is almost  ineffective, though, if participants do not know the distribution of  endowments. Granting the leaders exclusion power does not lead to  significantly higher contributions.","918":"This  research studied the effect of tip policy and visibility on service  quality in caf\u00e9s. Applying social dilemma research to caf\u00e9s suggests  that service quality may be deteriorated by two types of free-riding  behaviour. These free-riding behaviours include reduced-effort  activities and the overuse of limited common resources. The theoretical  framework implies that it is difficult to solve both problems  simultaneously. For example, an individual tip policy can solve the  problem of reduced effort as it motivates each server to work for his or  her own tip. However, this policy intensifies the competition between  the servers over limited common resources. Shared tip policy operates in  the opposite way, solving the latter problem yet intensifying the  former. Similarly, visibility conditions (moderating monitoring and  social comparison) affect the two free-riding behaviours in opposite  ways. Two field studies indicated that tip policy and visibility were  interacting and that quality service could be attained with two  combinations. Individual tip policy leads to quality service when  combined with low visibility. Shared tip policy leads to quality service  when combined with high visibility. The findings demonstrate the  difficulty, but also the potential of generalizing social dilemma  research to natural settings.","919":"Repeated  interaction in integroup conflict was studied in the context of two  team games: the intergroup public goods (IPG) game and the intergroup  prisoner's dilemma (IPD) game.

The second finding supports the hypothesis that subjects learn the  structure of the game and adapt their behavior accordingly and is  compatible with a simple learning model, which assumes that choices that  have led to good outcomes in the past are more likely to be repeated in  the future. A reciprocal cooperation hypothesis, which assumes that  players make their choices contingent on the earlier choices of the  other players, received little support.","920":"Eighty  groups of subjects participated in a social dilemma game, where two  groups competed with each other for the provision of a binary public  good.

In one condition preplay communication was restricted to ingroup  members; in another condition all members of the two competing groups  discussed the dilemma jointly with no opportunity for separate  within-group discussions; and in three other conditions various  combinations of within- and between-group preplay communication were  allowed. Within-group communication maximized contribution rate but  minimized collective outcome, whereas between-group communication had  the opposite effect. Intermediate levels of contribution were found in  the three mixed communication conditions.

The decision to contribute or not toward the provision of the  good was made privately and anonymously. Both the relative group size  and communication conditions affected the level of contribution. The  findings support a model predicting that within-group discussion results  in a two-person game between the two groups, each of which uses the  maximin criterion to designate a number of contributors.

Whereas the present studies aimed at investigating the same  research hypothesis, a different and more elaborate methodology was  used, as such providing a conceptual replication opportunity and  extension to the Everett et al. studies. Overall, the present studies  clearly confirmed the main finding of Everett et al., that deontologists  are more trusted than consequentialists in social dilemma games. Study 1  replicates Everett et al.\u2019s effect in the context of trust games. Study  2 generalizes the effect to public goods games, thus demonstrating that  it is not specific to the type of social dilemma game used in Everett  et al. Finally, both studies build on these results by demonstrating  that the increased trust in deontologists may sometimes, but not always,  be warranted: deontologists displayed increased cooperation rates but  only in the public goods game and not in trust games.

We  propose a stylized dynamic model that integrates these two dimensions.  A\u00a0distinguishing feature of our model is that the duration of the  game is determined endogenously by the users\u2019 collective  decisions. In the proposed model, if the resource stock level below  which the irreversible event occurs is known in advance, then the  optimal resource use coincides with a unique symmetric equilibrium that  guarantees survival of the resource. As the uncertainty about the  threshold level increases, resource use increases if users adopt  decision strategies that quickly deplete the resource stock, but  decreases if they adopt path strategies guaranteeing that the unknown  threshold level is never exceeded. We show that under relatively high  uncertainty about resource size, CPR users frequently implement decision  strategies that terminate the game immediately. When this uncertainty  is reduced, they maintain a positive resource level for longer  durations.","925":"  Abstract  In most real\u2010world commons, the exact resource quantity is  rarely known, and the rate at which the resource regenerates is not  always predictable.

We also find that participants who trust a)  non-Tsimane\u2019 and b) the authorities extract less than other  participants, but findings are not robust across rounds. Using the  economic and anthropological literature, we interpret the findings  arguing that trust in non-Tsimane\u2019, which is strongly correlated with  market access, may capture generalized trust levels and that people with  higher levels of generalized trust interact more easily in non-personal  transactions, like the situation presented in the game.

First, we replicate and  extend previous results showing that (as predicted by the SHH) trust of  daily-life interaction partners and previous experience with economic  games moderate the effect of time pressure\/delay in social dilemmas. We  then confirm a novel prediction of the SHH: that deliberation should not  undermine the decision to benefit others when doing so is also  individually payoff-maximizing.

This intuitive-cooperation effect is of high scientific and  practical importance because it argues against a central assumption of  traditional economic and evolutionary models.

Andreoni (1998) argues that such a  fundraising strategy may be particularly effective when funds are being  raised for projects that have fixed production costs. The reason is  that when there are fixed costs of production simultaneous giving may  result in both positive and zero provision equilibria. Thus absent  announcements donors may get stuck in an equilibrium that fails to  provide a desirable public project. Andreoni (1998) demonstrates that  such inferior outcomes can be eliminated when the fundraiser initially  secures a sufficiently large seed donation. We investigate this model  experimentally to determine whether announcements of seed money  eliminate the inefficiencies that may result under fixed costs and  simultaneous provision. To assess the strength of the theory we examine  the effect of announcements in both the presence and absence of fixed  costs.

While the burden-sharing  principles commonly advocated in climate negotiations reflect different  views of what constitutes a fair way to distribute the abatement burden,  their use can also be strategically motivated to legitimise a specific  bargaining position. In this context, using a threshold public good game  with a climate change framing, real monetary incentives and drawing on a  sample of individuals from the United States, the European Union,  China, India and South Africa, this multi-country study examines the  degree to which the use of burden-sharing principles reflects material  self-interest.

In this context, using a  public good game with a climate change framing, the experiment reported  here examines whether groups of heterogeneous individuals can meet a  collective emission-reduction target through individual contributions.  In terms of the framing, participants differ in terms of their marginal  costs of abatement. The experiment consists of two games: a  counterfactual baseline scenario examining the scope for voluntary  cooperation and a communication game examining the role of stakeholder  participation in facilitating cooperation. During the communication  game, subjects are able to communicate with one another in order to  coordinate contribution strategies. The results suggest that relying on  the voluntary cooperation of individuals will not be sufficient to meet  the mitigation target. Furthermore, while communication plays a role in  promoting cooperation, even when heterogeneity is present, the  non-binding nature of communication results in significant levels of  free-riding.

The implications of such defensive  processes for cooperation in social dilemmas are discussed.","990":"  Abstract  Sometimes people may no longer engage in conservational  behavior (e.g., to reduce emissions) because their attempts to do so  have been thwarted by \u201cnegative noise\u201d, or external forces that may  cause otherwise cooperative intentions to translate into non\u2010cooperative  action (e.g., strikes prevented to commute by public transport rather  than by car). The purpose of the present research is to examine whether  experiences with negative noise in a commons dilemma may undermine  conservational motivation and behavior, even in a subsequent commons  dilemma that is free of noise. Participants first interacted in a  commons dilemma task\u2014with noise versus without noise\u2014in which the common  pool was sustained versus deteriorating. Afterwards, participants were  involved in an identical second task in the same pool size condition but  noise\u2010free for everybody. Consistent with hypotheses, participants who  faced noise and a deteriorating resource in the first task exhibited  lower levels of conservation in the second task than did participants  who were always acting free of noise. This pattern was mediated by a  reduced motivation to preserve the common pool, suggesting that the  experience of noise in combination with a decline in collective  resources may especially undermine cooperative motivation and behavior.

","991":"  Abstract  Simmons, Dawes and Orbell (1984) suggested that greed  provides a more important motive for non\u2010cooperation in a social dilemma  than fear. However, there are at least three reasons to reinvestigate  the relative impact of fear and greed on cooperation in social dilemmas.  First, the Simmons et al. results were not replicated in a recent study  (Van Avermaet and Van Nieuwkerke, in press). Second in the two  forementioned studies a step\u2010level public good game was employed, a game  which does not meet the formal requirements of social dilemmas as they  were defined by Dawes (1980). Third, in contrast to previous research,  we employed a complete experimental design to investigate the effect of  the saliency of the two motives. In the present study, 128 subjects were randomly assigned to  one of four conditions in a 2 (saliency of fear: high, low) \u00d7 2  (saliency of greed: high, low) factorial design. First of all it  appeared that our fear and greed manipulation was successful. In  addition the results indicated a significant interaction effect:  cooperation was highest when both motives had a low saliency.   ","992":"Measures of exploitativeness evidence problems with validity and  reliability. The present set of studies assessed a new measure [the  Interpersonal Exploitativeness Scale (IES)] that defines  exploitativeness in terms of reciprocity. In Studies 1 and 2, 33 items  were administered to participants. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor  Analysis demonstrated that a single factor consisting of six items  adequately assess interpersonal exploitativeness. Study 3 results  revealed that the IES was positively associated with \u201cnormal\u201d  narcissism, pathological narcissism, psychological entitlement, and  negative reciprocity and negatively correlated with positive  reciprocity. In Study 4, participants competed in a commons dilemma.  Those who scored higher on the IES were more likely to harvest a greater  share of resources over time, even while controlling for other relevant  variables, such as entitlement. Together, these studies show the IES to  be a valid and reliable measure of interpersonal exploitativeness. The  authors discuss the implications of these studies.","993":" Nine  studies were conducted with the goal of developing a self-report  measure of psychological entitlement and assessing its interpersonal  consequences. The Psychological Entitlement Scale (PES) was found to be  reliable and valid (Study 1, 2), not associated with social desirability  (Study 2), stable across time (Study 3), and correlated negatively with  two of the Big Five factors: agreeableness and emotional stability  (Study 4). The validity of the PES was confirmed in studies that  assessed willingness to take candy designated for children (Study 5) and  reported deservingness of pay in a hypothetical employment setting  (Study 6). Finally, the PES was linked to important interpersonal  consequences including competitive choices in a commons dilemma (Study  7), selfish approaches to romantic relationships (Study 8), and  aggression following ego threat (Study 9). Psychological entitlement has  a pervasive and largely unconstructive impact on social behavior. ","994":"We  investigate the welfare implications of unfair incentive contracts in  comparison with interactions without contracts. Reciprocal people should  cooperate conditionally in the latter situation but punish unfairness  by non-cooperation. We confirm that some people do cooperate  conditionally in a sequential prisoner's dilemma. Furthermore, some  subjects do not cooperate if they face an unfair incentive contract in a  similar context. However, there is no correlation between these two  types of reciprocity. At an aggregate level, all contracts \u2013 no matter  how fair they are \u2013 improve welfare even if agents are conditionally  cooperative.Highlights\u25ba  Experiment comparing unfair incentive contracts to interactions without  contracts. \u25ba Within-subject comparison. \u25ba We observe conditional  cooperation in the situation without contracts and non-cooperative  behavior as a reaction to unfair contracts. \u25ba Main result: No  correlation between positive and negative reciprocity. \u25ba Welfare is  maximized in situations with contracts, irrespective of their fairness.","995":"Highlights\u2022We study whether the initial provision of strong incentives to cooperate backfires in the long run.\u2022We study 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 rounds of a public good game with punishment in a fixed-partners design.\u2022Subjects with a higher MPCR in rounds 1\u201310 contributed more to the public good in rounds 11 and 12.\u2022Initially low punishment costs did not produce significantly higher contributions in later rounds.\u2022Contributions rapidly decline after the removal of strong incentives.AbstractThis  paper investigates whether providing strong cooperation incentives only  at the outset of a group interaction spills over to later periods to  ensure cooperation in the long run. We study a repeated linear  public-good game with punishment opportunities and a parameter change  after the first ten (of twenty) rounds. Our data shows that cooperation  among subjects who had experienced a higher marginal return on  public-good contributions or low punishment costs in rounds 1\u201310 rapidly  deteriorated in rounds 11\u201320 once these incentives were removed,  eventually trending below the level of cooperation in the control group.  This suggests the possibility of temporary incentives backfiring in the  long run. This paper ties in with the literature highlighting the  potentially adverse effects of the use of incentives.","996":"['substantial', 'number', 'people', 'exhibit', 'social', 'preferences', 'means', 'solely', 'motivated', 'material', 'self', 'interest', 'care', 'positively', 'negatively', 'payoffs', 'relevant', 'reference', 'agents', 'show', 'empirically', 'economists', 'fail', 'understand', 'fundamental', 'economic', 'questions', 'disregard', 'without', 'taking', 'account', 'adequately', 'effects', 'competition', 'market', 'outcomes', 'laws', 'governing', 'cooperation', 'collective', 'action', 'determinants', 'incentives', 'iv', 'contracts', 'property', 'rights', 'arrangements', 'optimal', 'v', 'important', 'forces', 'shaping', 'norms', 'failures']","997":"We  introduce a novel mechanism to eliminate endgame effects in repeated  prisoner\u2019s dilemma experiments. In the main phase of a supergame our  mechanism generates more persistent cooperation than finite horizon or  random continuation rules. Moreover, we find evidence for  cooperation-enhancing \u201cactive\/reactive\u201d strategies which concentrate in  the initial phase of a supergame as subjects gain experience.","998":"Using  a symmetric two-player prisoners\u2019 dilemma as base game, each player  receives a signal for the number of rounds to be played with the same  partner. One of these signals is the true number of rounds R while the other is R  \u2212 5. Thus both players know that the game has a finite end. They both  know that the opponent knows this, but the finite end is not commonly  known. As a consequence, both mutual defection and mutual cooperation  until the second last round are subgame perfect equilibrium outcomes. We  find experimental evidence that many players do in fact cooperate  beyond their individual signal round.","999":"In  repeated public goods experiments, ruling out information about an  exact, commonly known, and symmetric terminal period does not alter  average contributions significantly, although asymmetric information  about the time horizon reduces the frequency of end-game effects.","1000":" Abstract Maintaining the Earth\u2019s climate within habitable  boundaries is probably the greatest \u201cpublic goods game\u201d played by  humans. However, with &gt;6 billion \u201cplayers\u201d taking part, the game  seems to rule out individual altruistic behavior. Thus, climate  protection is a problem of sustaining a public resource that everybody  is free to overuse, a \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d problem that emerges in  many social dilemmas. We perform a previously undescribed type of public  goods experiment with human subjects contributing to a public pool. In  contrast to the standard protocol, here the common pool is not divided  among the participants; instead, it is promised that the pool will be  invested to encourage people to reduce their fossil fuel use. Our  extensive experiments demonstrate that players can behave altruistically  to maintain the Earth\u2019s climate given the right set of circumstances.  We find a nonzero basic level of altruistic behavior, which is enhanced  if the players are provided with expert information describing the state  of knowledge in climate research. Furthermore, personal investments in  climate protection increase substantially if players can invest  publicly, thus gaining social reputation. This increase occurs because  subjects reward other subjects\u2019 contributions to sustaining the climate,  thus reinforcing their altruism. Therefore, altruism may convert to net  personal benefit and to relaxing the dilemma if the gain in reputation  is large enough. Our finding that people reward contributions to  sustaining the climate of others is a surprising result. There are  obvious ways these unexpected findings can be applied on a large scale. climate changepublic goods gamereputationtragedy of the commons ","1001":"\"\/>

In this hybrid social  dilemma, individuals can choose to give or to take resources from a  shared resource pool. Previous empirical work by McCarter, Budescu, and  Scheffran (2011) found that the composition of the group and the  individuals\u2019 endowments influenced their tendency to give and\/or take.  We reanalyze results from two experiments from McCarter, Budescu, et al.  (2011) using the new paradigm and propose a simple model of individual  behavior based on the players\u2019 perceptions of their relative standing in  the group and their perception of fair allocations. We also use these  data to fit the model at the individual level and use it to provide a  general framework for interpreting the group results.","1003":"Contributions  to public goods are premised on the expectation that the collective  will realize benefit in excess of the value of required contributions.  However, past research has focused on public goods of fixed and known  value, for which the added value of the produced public good is obvious.  Research has largely ignored public goods whose eventual value is  uncertain at the time contribution decisions are made. Two studies  explored the effects of outcome variance on individuals\u2019 contributions  to a public good and their reasons for contributing. Contributions were  negatively affected by loss prospects in the distribution of possible  outcomes. Further, loss prospects directly discouraged contributions  because of loss aversion, and indirectly discouraged contributions by  fueling fears that others would not contribute. The negative effects of  loss prospects were stronger when social uncertainty was low.  Implications for social dilemma research and the effective management of  collective action are discussed.","1004":"We  describe and empirically investigate a hybrid social dilemma that  merges give-some and take-some dilemmas by allowing individuals to  choose to either give or to take resources from a shared resource pool.  Study 1 finds that (a) group size increases the inequality among group  members and the likelihood of creating the public good, while reducing  the amount of wasted resources; (b) larger bonuses increase provision  rates; and (c) asymmetry in the wealth distribution of the group members  induces higher levels of inequality of the final outcomes. Following  the logic of appropriateness, players with high (low) endowments were  more likely to give toward (take from) the shared resource. Study 2  finds that the tendency of the players with high (low) endowments to  give (take) is amplified as the difference between endowment levels  increased, and the players\u2019 behavior is correlated with, and predictable  from, independent judgments of what is perceived as appropriate.","1005":"We experimentally investigate the fundamental element of the level-k  model of reasoning, the level-0 actions and beliefs. We use data from a  novel experimental design that allows us to obtain incentivised written  accounts of individuals' reasoning. In particular, these accounts allow  to infer level-0 beliefs. Level-0 beliefs are not significantly  different from 50, and almost 60% of higher level players start their  reasoning from a level-0 belief of exactly 50. We also estimate that  around one third of the participants play non-strategically. The  non-strategic level-0 actions are not uniformly distributed.","1006":"A  laboratory experiment where human subjects play a repeated public goods  game with high-powered punishment technology (50:1). Results on three  attributes are similar to lower-powered punishment settings (e.g., 3:1):  Subjects contribute almost 100\u00a0% to the public good, punishment  rates are low (under 10\u00a0% of maximum), and punishment is directed  more toward low contributors. In contrast to lower-powered punishment  settings, however, subjects earn less money than they would have in the  same setting without punishment. These results contribute to the debate  about the origins and maintenance of cooperation.","1007":"Cooperation,  where one individual incurs a cost to help another, is a fundamental  building block of the natural world and human society. It has been  suggested that costly punishment can promote the evolution of  cooperation, with the threat of punishment deterring free-riders. Recent  experiments, however, have revealed the existence of 'antisocial'  punishment, where non-cooperators punish cooperators. While various  theoretical models find that punishment can promote the evolution of  cooperation, these models a priori exclude the possibility of antisocial  punishment. Here we extend the standard theory of optional public goods  games to include the full set of punishment strategies. We find that  punishment no longer increases cooperation, and that selection favours  substantial levels of antisocial punishment for a wide range of  parameters. Furthermore, we conduct behavioural experiments, showing  results consistent with our model predictions. As opposed to an  altruistic act that promotes cooperation, punishment is mostly a  self-interested tool for protecting oneself against potential  competitors.","1008":"Highlights\u2022The racial composition of groups was varied in a large sample public goods game.\u2022Racial homogeneity does not uniformly predict higher contributions to the public good.\u2022Race appears to convey information about heterogeneity in other dimensions.\u2022Communication is affected by the racial identity of individuals and their groups.AbstractWe  report the results from a series of public goods games in which the  racial composition of the group was exogenously varied. Contrary to  predictions from social psychology, we find that visible racial  homogeneity in a group does not uniformly predict higher contributions  to the public account. Rather, our results suggest that in homogenous  groups, observable racial identity may convey information about  heterogeneity in other dimensions, especially where race is highly  correlated with diversity in other dimensions, such as linguistic  diversity, low intra-group trust and socio-economic need. Thus, racial  identity loses its salience in the absence of any visibly identifiable  out-group members, but other dimensions of identity increase their  salience. Moreover, while communication has a large and significant  positive effect on contributions to the public pool, patterns of  communication are affected by the racial composition of the group.","1009":"Highlights\u2022We study the effect of social fragmentation on public good contributions.\u2022We study how social identity preferences can explain the negative relationship between fragmentation and cooperation.\u2022Higher fragmentation leads to lower contribution levels by members of the majority group.\u2022Homogeneous groups perform as well as highly fragmented groups.AbstractWe  study the role of social identity in determining the impact of social  fragmentation on public good provision using laboratory experiments. We  find that as long as there is some degree of social fragmentation,  increasing it leads to lower public good provision by majority group  members. This is mainly because the share of those in the majority group  who contribute fully to the public good diminishes with social  fragmentation, while the share of free-riders is unchanged. This  suggests social identity preferences drive our result, as opposed to self-interest.  Importantly, we find no difference in contribution between homogeneous  and maximally-fragmented treatments, reinforcing our finding that  majority groups contribute most in the presence of some diversity.","1010":"Economic  games are often used in an attempt to reveal the underlying preferences  or motivations that govern human behaviour. However, this approach  relies on the implicit assumption that individuals are rational and  fully aware of the consequences of their decisions. We examined  behaviour in a standard economic game that is often used to measure  social preferences: the public-goods game. We found that giving  information to individuals about the relative success of their group led  to (1) significantly higher levels of cooperation and (2) emotional  responses to group success. This is despite the fact that group success  had no effect on the payoffs in our game, and so knowledge of group  success should not influence the behaviour of rational players.  Consequently, these results suggest that cues of group competition have  an automatic or unconscious effect on human behaviour that can induce  increased within-group cooperation. More generally, this framing effect  emphasizes the potential problem with drawing biological conclusions  from the quantitative comparison of cooperation levels in economic games  with the predictions of theory. Instead, our results emphasize the  advantage of testing theory by qualitatively comparing behaviour across  treatments, and with regard to expected adaptations and expected ontogeny.Highlights\u25ba  We manipulate human behaviour in an economic public-goods game without  affecting payoffs. \u25ba We give individuals information about the relative  success of their group. \u25ba This information induces emotional responses  to group success\/failure. \u25ba Such group comparisons lead to significantly  increased cooperation. \u25ba We stress the advantage of qualitative over  quantitative tests in ethology.","1011":"Understanding  how societies resolve conflicts between individual and common interests  remains one of the most fundamental issues across disciplines. The  observation that humans readily incur costs to sanction uncooperative  individuals without tangible individual benefits has attracted  considerable attention as a proximate cause as to why cooperative  behaviours might evolve. However, the proliferation of individually  costly punishment has been difficult to explain. Several studies over  the last decade employing experimental designs with isolated groups have  found clear evidence that the costs of punishment often nullify the  benefits of increased cooperation, rendering the strong human tendency  to punish a thorny evolutionary puzzle. Here, we show that group  competition enhances the effectiveness of punishment so that when groups  are in direct competition, individuals belonging to a group with  punishment opportunity prevail over individuals in a group without this  opportunity. In addition to competitive superiority in between-group  competition, punishment reduces within-group variation in success,  creating circumstances that are highly favourable for the evolution of  accompanying group-functional behaviours. We find that the individual  willingness to engage in costly punishment increases with tightening  competitive pressure between groups. Our results suggest the importance  of intergroup conflict behind the emergence of costly punishment and  human cooperation.","1012":"Understanding  the ultimate and proximate mechanisms that favour cooperation remains  one of the greatest challenges in the biological and social sciences.  A number of theoretical studies have suggested that competition between  groups may have played a key role in the evolution of cooperation  within human societies, and similar ideas have been discussed for other  organisms, especially cooperative breeding vertebrates.  However, there is a relative lack of empirical work testing these  ideas. Our experiment found, in public goods games with humans, that  when groups competed with other groups for financial rewards,  individuals made larger contributions within their own groups. In such  situations, participants were more likely to regard their group mates as  collaborators rather than competitors. Variation in contribution among  individuals, either with or without intergroup competition, was  positively correlated with individuals' propensity to regard group mates  as collaborators. We found that the levels of both guilt and anger  individuals experienced were a function of their own contributions and  those of their group mates. Overall, our results are consistent with the  idea that the level of cooperation can be influenced by proximate  emotions, which vary with the degree of intergroup competition.","1013":"We experimentally investigate the effect of intergroup competition \u2013 with\/out monetary incentives to win  \u2013 on intragroup cooperation. In one-shot games, competition increases  cooperation with\/out incentives. In finitely repeated games, cooperation  is sustained with incentives. Cooperation decreases (increases) in  response to wins (losses).","1014":"<jats:p>Economic experiments are often used to study if humans altruistically value the welfare of others. A canonical result from public-good games is that humans vary in how they value the welfare of others, dividing into fair-minded conditional cooperators, who match the cooperation of others, and selfish noncooperators. However, an alternative explanation for the data are that individuals vary in their understanding of how to maximize income, with misunderstanding leading to the appearance of cooperation. We show that (<jats:italic>i<\/jats:italic>) individuals divide into the same behavioral types when playing with computers, whom they cannot be concerned with the welfare of; (<jats:italic>ii<\/jats:italic>) behavior across games with computers and humans is correlated and can be explained by variation in understanding of how to maximize income; (<jats:italic>iii<\/jats:italic>) misunderstanding correlates with higher levels of cooperation; and (<jats:italic>iv<\/jats:italic>) standard control questions do not guarantee understanding. These results cast doubt on certain experimental methods and demonstrate that a common assumption in behavioral economics experiments, that choices reveal motivations, will not necessarily hold.<\/jats:p>","1015":"Highlights\u2022We measure response times in a large-scale public good experiment.\u2022The strategy method enables us to classify subjects into cooperator types.\u2022Free riders spend much more time before reaching their decision.\u2022The result is robust to changing the framing of the game.AbstractWe  use the strategy method to classify subjects into cooperator types in a  large-scale online Public Goods Game and find that free riders spend  more time on making their decisions than conditional cooperators and  other cooperator types. This result is robust to reversing the framing  of the game and is not driven by cognitive ability, confusion, or  natural swiftness in responding. Our results suggest that conditional  cooperation serves as a norm and that free riders need time to resolve a  moral dilemma.","1016":"Economic  game experiments have become a prominent method among social scientists  developing and testing theories of cooperation. These games provide a  valuable opportunity to generate measures of cooperation that can be  compared from one place to the next, yet challenges remain in how to  interpret cross-cultural differences in these experiments and connect  them to cooperation in naturally occurring contexts. I address these  challenges by examining framing effects in public goods games (PGGs)  with salmon fishers and reindeer herders in Kamchatka, Russia. Combining  standard versions of the game with versions that refer to post-Soviet  institutions coordinating fishing and herding, I show that (1) average  contributions in the PGG in Kamchatka are substantially higher than  reported elsewhere and (2) framing the PGG alters the relationship  between contributions and expectations, shifting strategies away from  unconditional generosity and toward conditional cooperation. My  analysis, by synthesizing quantitative analysis of PGG data with  long-term qualitative ethnography, including extensive postgame  interviews with participants, supports the notion that cooperation in  economic games increases along with cultural norms, values, and  institutions that emerge from economic interdependence. Framing effects  suggest that researchers should devote more attention to investigating  the relationship between contributions and expectations.","1017":"\/6\/3\/338\/1647903\/ by vrije universiteit amsterdam user on 07 october 2019ibaraki 305-8573, japancooperation among genetically unrelated individuals is a fundamental aspect of society, but it has been a longstanding puzzlein biological and social sciences. recently, theoretical studies in biology and economics showed that conditional cooper-ation\u0002cooperating only with those who have exhibited cooperative behavior\u0002can spread over a society. furthermore, experimen-tal studies in psychology demonstrated that people are actually conditional cooperators. in this study, we used functionalmagnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural system underlying conditional cooperation by scanning participantsduring interaction with cooperative, neutral and non-cooperative opponents in prisoner\u2019s dilemma games. the results showedthat: (i) participants cooperated more frequently with both cooperative and neutral opponents than with non-cooperative oppon-ents; and (ii) a brain area related to cognitive inhibition of pre-potent responses (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) showedgreater activation, especially when participants confronted non-cooperative opponents. consequently, we suggest that cognitiveinhibition of the motivation to cooperate with non-cooperators drives the conditional behavior.","1018":"This  paper introduces new experimental designs to examine how conditional  cooperation and punishment behaviours respond to the full range of  variation in the contributions of others. It is shown that contributions  become significantly more selfish-biased as others contribute more  unequally, while punishment increases both with decreasing contributions  by the target player and increasing contributions by a third player.  Low contributors who punish antisocially do not direct their punishment  specifically toward high contributors, while their beliefs indicate that  they expect to themselves be punished.","1019":"In  the context of social dilemmas, previous research has shown that human  cooperation is mainly based on the social norm of conditional  cooperation. While in most cases individuals behave according to such a  norm, deviant behavior is no exception. Recent research further suggests  that heterogeneity in social behavior might be associated with varying  genetic predispositions. In this study, we investigated the relationship  between individuals' behavior in a public goods experiment and the  promoter-region functional repeat polymorphism in the monoamine oxidase A  gene (MAOA). In a dynamic setting of increasing information  about others' contributions, we analyzed differences in two main  components of conditional cooperation, namely the players' own  contribution and their beliefs regarding the contribution of other  players. We showed that there is a significant association between  individuals' behavior in a repeated public goods game and MAOA.  Our results suggest that male carriers of the low activity alleles  cooperate significantly less than those carrying the high activity  alleles given a situation where subjects had to rely on their innate  beliefs about others' contributions. With increasing information about  the others' cooperativeness, the genetic effect diminishes. Furthermore,  significant opposing effects for female subjects carrying two low  activity alleles were observed. ","1020":"We  use instrumental variables for estimating the causal effect of beliefs  on contributions in repeated public good games. The effect is about half  as large as suggested by ordinary least squares. Thus, we present  evidence that beliefs have a causal effect on contributions, but also  that beliefs are endogenous. We compare the causal, belief-based model  of contributions to alternative models based on matching the previous  contributions of others and responding to one\u2019s deviation from the  average in the previous round. The causal, belief-based model performs  well, indicating that beliefs have a central role in determining  contributions.","1021":"Laboratory  experiments have documented substantial heterogeneity in social  preferences, but little is known about the origins of such behavior.  Previous research on public goods experiments suggests that  individual-level demographic and psychological variables correlate with  player types. However, the key question about biological sources of  variation in these preferences remains open. The aim of this study is to  uncover genetic variations that influence differences in cooperative  behavior. For this reason, we identify types of players within a  strategic public goods experiment. We explicitly test for an association  between individual variance in strategy choice and the functional  promoter-region repeat of the Monoamine Oxidase A gene (MAOA). Our experimental findings suggest a link between MAOA and the occurrence of free-riding in females. Females with MAOA-L are less likely to behave like weak free-riders than MAOA-H  carriers, whereas among males, our results did not support a  significant relation between genotype and player type. Furthermore, MAOA-L female carriers contribute more than MAOA-H  subjects to the public good if they know that others contribute  nothing, and they showed slightly lower scores on the Machiavellianism  scale. This is the first piece of evidence that genotype might predict  player type within a public goods setting. It contributes to our  understanding of biological drivers of economic decision making and  points to the need for further exploration.

To test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated the  extent an individual's behaviour is known to others, and hence whether  or not strategic cooperation is possible. In contrast with many previous  studies, we avoided confounding factors by preventing individuals from  learning during the game about either pay-offs or about how other  individuals behave. We found clear evidence for strategic  cooperators\u2014just telling some individuals that their groupmates would be  informed about their behaviour led to them tripling their initial level  of cooperation, from 17 to 50%. We also found that many individuals  play as if they do not understand the game, and their presence obscures  the detection of strategic cooperation. Identifying such players allowed  us to detect and study strategic motives for cooperation in novel, more  powerful, ways.","1023":"A  defining aspect of human cooperation is the use of sophisticated  indirect reciprocity. We observe others, talk about others, and act  accordingly. We help those who help others, and we cooperate expecting  that others will cooperate in return. Indirect reciprocity is based on  reputation, which spreads by communication. A crucial aspect of indirect  reciprocity is observability: reputation effects can support  cooperation as long as peoples\u2019 actions can be observed by others. In  evolutionary models of indirect reciprocity, natural selection favors  cooperation when observability is sufficiently high. Complimenting this  theoretical work are experiments where observability promotes  cooperation among small groups playing games in the laboratory. Until  now, however, there has been little evidence of observability\u2019s power to  promote large-scale cooperation in real world settings. Here we provide  such evidence using a field study involving 2413 subjects. We  collaborated with a utility company to study participation in a program  designed to prevent blackouts. We show that observability triples  participation in this public goods game. The effect is over four times  larger than offering a $25 monetary incentive, the company\u2019s previous  policy. Furthermore, as predicted by indirect reciprocity, we provide  evidence that reputational concerns are driving our observability  effect. In sum, we show how indirect reciprocity can be harnessed to  increase cooperation in a relevant, real-world public goods game.","1024":"Humans  have a sophisticated ability to learn from others, termed social  learning, which has allowed us to spread over the planet, construct  complex societies, and travel to the moon. It has been hypothesized that  social learning has played a pivotal role in making human societies  cooperative, by favouring cooperation even when it is not favoured by  genetical selection. However, this hypothesis lacks direct experimental  testing, and the opposite prediction has also been made, that social  learning disfavours cooperation. We experimentally tested how different  aspects of social learning affect the level of cooperation in  public-goods games. We found that: (i) social information never  increased cooperation and usually led to decreased cooperation; (ii)  cooperation was lowest when individuals could observe how successful  individuals behaved; and (iii) cooperation declined because individuals  preferred to copy successful individuals, who cooperated less, rather  than copy common behaviours. Overall, these results suggest that  individuals use social information to try and improve their own success,  and that this can lead to lower levels of cooperation.","1025":"A  popular approach to explain over-contribution in public good games is  based on the assumption that people care (either positively or  negatively) about the utility of other participants. Over-contribution  then is an outcome of utility maximization where utility depends on  subjects\u2019 own payoffs as well as on the payoffs of other players.  In this paper, I study to what extent this assumption of utility  interdependence is responsible for over-contribution. I design three  treatments where subjects\u2019 decisions cannot affect opponents\u2019 payoffs  and thus utility interdependence cannot explain cooperative behavior.  The main result is that while average contribution in these treatments  is below the benchmark it nonetheless stays well above zero. Even when  no one benefits from subjects\u2019 generosity the average contributions are  as high as one third of the endowment and are only 25% below those in  the benchmark level. This suggests that utility interdependence is not  the main factor responsible for over-contribution.","1026":"<jats:p>It has often been argued that the spectacular cognitive capacities of humans are the result of selection for the ability to gather, process, and use information about other people. Recent studies show that humans strongly and consistently differ in what type of social information they are interested in. Although some individuals mainly attend to what the majority is doing (frequency-based learning), others focus on the success that their peers achieve with their behavior (success-based learning). Here, we show that such differences in social learning have important consequences for the outcome of social interactions. We report on a decision-making experiment in which individuals were first classified as frequency- and success-based learners and subsequently grouped according to their learning strategy. When confronted with a social dilemma situation, groups of frequency-based learners cooperated considerably more than groups of success-based learners. A detailed analysis of the decision-making process reveals that these differences in cooperation are a direct result of the differences in information use. Our results show that individual differences in social learning strategies are crucial for understanding social behavior.<\/jats:p>","1027":"Highlights\u2022We investigate behavior under different amounts of information including a \u2018black box\u2019 treatment.\u2022We test certain trial-and-error rules that have been proposed for such \u2018black box\u2019 environments.\u2022Our  findings provide behavioral support for key constituents of such  learning models.

Theory shows that even when players  have no such information, there are simple payoff-based learning rules  that lead to Nash equilibrium in many types of games. A key feature of  these rules is that subjects search differently depending on whether  their payoffs increase, stay constant or decrease. This paper analyzes  learning behavior in a laboratory setting and finds strong confirmation  for these asymmetric search behaviors in the context of voluntary  contribution games. By varying the amount of information we show that  these behaviors are also present even when subjects have full  information about the game.","1028":"Helping  is a cornerstone of social organization and commonplace in human  societies. A major challenge for the evolutionary sciences is to explain  how cooperation is maintained in large populations with high levels of  migration, conditions under which cooperators can be exploited by  selfish individuals. Cultural group selection models posit that such  large-scale cooperation evolves via selection acting on populations  among which behavioural variation is maintained by the cultural  transmission of cooperative norms. These models assume that individuals  acquire cooperative strategies via social learning. This assumption  remains empirically untested. Here, I test this by investigating whether  individuals employ conformist or payoff-biased learning in public goods  games conducted in 14 villages of a forager\u2013horticulturist society, the  Pahari Korwa of India. Individuals did not show a clear tendency to  conform or to be payoff-biased and are highly variable in their use of  social learning. This variation is partly explained by both individual  and village characteristics. The tendency to conform decreases and to be  payoff-biased increases as the value of the modal contribution  increases. These findings suggest that the use of social learning in  cooperative dilemmas is contingent on individuals' circumstances and  environments, and question the existence of stably transmitted cultural  norms of cooperation.","1029":" We  use a two-person public goods experiment to investigate how much agents  value conditional cooperation when symmetric positive contributions  entail efficiency losses.

To assess a priori cooperative preferences,  we measure individual \u2018value-orientations\u2019 by means of the decomposed  game technique.

Here we  report an experiment in which participants in public goods games could  access information about the lowest, median, or highest contribution to  the public good before making their own contribution decisions. Results  suggest that people have clear preferences for particular pieces of  information and that information preferences vary systematically across  individuals as a function of their contribution strategies.  Specifically, participants playing reciprocal strategies sought  information about the median contribution, free riders preferred to view  the highest contribution, and altruists had inconsistent preferences.  By including a treatment in which people could pay to see information  rather than obtaining it for free, we found that people were willing to  incur costs to acquire information, particularly those using a  reciprocal strategy. Further, adding a cost to view information  decreased aggregate contributions, possibly because the motivation to  induce others' reciprocal contributions diminished under these  conditions.

However, many researchers have questioned this folk  hypothesis1,2,3,4,5,6,  arguing that testosterone is primarily involved in status-related  behaviours in challenging social interactions, but causal evidence that  discriminates between these views is sparse.

We therefore predicted that a low 2D:4D  would be associated with high levels of egoism and altruism and low  levels of common cooperativeness (i.e. contributing exactly one's fair  share). We found the exact opposite: participants with a low 2D:4D were  more likely to act cooperatively and less likely to act altruistically  and egoistically.

T is  a hormone with well known effect on males' behaviour, and that promotes  activities that seek to increase reproductive success. Fluctuating  Asymmetry (FA) reflects the ability of the organism to maintain a stable  development and it is usually employed as a variable reflecting genetic  quality (low FA values are thought to signal higher genetic quality).  Our results show that subjects with intermediate levels of second to  fourth digit ratio (a proxy of exposure to T in utero) and with high FA  cooperate more often in the PDG. We also observe that the latter effect  is due to the fact that FA has an impact on subjects' expectations about  the behaviour of their counterpart in the game.

Both  effects are stronger when authorities, as compared to randomly selected  community members, lead by example. We explore two underlying sources of  leadership influence. First, we provide evidence that the effect of a  leader's contribution is not limited to signaling the value of the  public good.

Furthermore, a  recent study found that time pressure increases cooperation even in a  game framed as a competition, suggesting that the time pressure effect  is not the result of social norm compliance. Here, we successfully  replicate these findings, again observing a positive effect of time  pressure on cooperation in a competitively framed game, but not when  using the standard cooperative framing.

Results  showed, first of all, that self-sacrificial decisions to contribute were  made faster than decisions not to contribute, and that faster decision  time associated with more positive expectations of in-group members.  Second, we observed that lowering impulse control with a difficult  rather than easy Stroop Task increased the amount contributed to a pool  that benefited in-group members while harming out-group members; thus  reducing deliberation increased parochial altruism.

We report on a laboratory experiment  exploring whether the choice of some to contribute money in lieu effort  affects the voluntary contributions of those who continue to provide  effort. Subjects complete lab tasks as a contribution to a public good \u2013  carbon emission reductions. These effort contributions decrease as  peers accept an offer to contribute money instead of effort. However,  the aggregate result masks significant heterogeneity. Those who choose  not to buy out despite its expected profitability have no response to  the treatment, while those for whom it would not be profitable to buy  out register large reductions in effort contributions. The magnitude of  these responses increases in the share of the group accepting the  buyout, suggesting that is the act of peers buying out \u2013 rather than the  introduction of monetary incentives \u2013 that drives the effect.","1074":"ABSTRACTThe  studies described in this article explore the influence of an  under-emphasized determinant of cooperative behavior in social dilemmas:  affected third parties. Two experiments examined the effect of  characteristics of third parties on individual cooperative behavior in  social dilemmas, and identified mechanisms associated with these  relationships. Study 1 demonstrated that third-party need affects  individual cooperative behavior, and tested prosocial motivation and  intra-group trust as mediators of this relationship. Study 2 provided  further elaboration by demonstrating that individual cooperative  behavior was reduced when a needy third party was low on reliability,  and by showing that prosocial motivation and intra-group trust mediated  this relationship. This research connects the literatures on individual  cooperation in social dilemmas and relational job design, and  demonstrates why third parties influence individuals\u2019 cooperative  behavior.","1075":"Different  disciplines have analyzed binary choices to model collective behavior  in human systems. Several situations in which social dilemma arise can  be modeled as N-person prisoner\u2019s dilemma games including  homeland security, public goods, international political economy among  others. The purpose of this study is to develop an analytical solution  to the N-person prisoner\u2019s dilemma game when boundedly rational  agents interact in a population. Previous studies in the literature  consider the case in which cooperators and defectors have the same  learning factors. We obtain an analytical equation to find equilibria in  the N-person prisoner\u2019s dilemma game in the general case when  agents have different learning factors. We also introduce a more  realistic approach where probability values are bounded between zero and  one and therefore eliminates the possibility of infeasible probability  values. Since no analytic solution can be derived in this case, agent  based simulation is used to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the  resulted dynamical system.","1076":"Many  real-life social dilemmas contain third parties who cannot make  decisions in the dilemma, but are affected by its outcome (receive  externalities) nonetheless. Dilemmas with identical payoffs for  decision-making actors may greatly vary in their externalities for third parties.  If actors value the welfare of thirds, externalities will affect  actors\u2019 decisions. We test behavioral predictions from three leading  ideas on social preferences (altruism, inequality aversion, competition)  in two studies that employ four one-shot, 2-person prisoner\u2019s dilemmas  (PDs) that differ only in their externalities. The PDs respectively  include a third party that (i) is indifferent, (ii) prefers defection,  (iii) prefers cooperation. Our results show that while aggregate  behavior is not affected by externalities, individual behavior is.  Compared to a PD without externalities, prosocial individuals cooperate  more when a third benefits from cooperation, but do not defect more when  a third benefits from defection. The opposite pattern is found for  competitive individuals.","1077":"Many forest ecosystems  provide multiple goods and services to both local users (e.g. firewood,  water) and to other external beneficiaries (biodiversity conservation,  carbon sequestration). This calls for alternative approaches in the  governance of these local ecosystems. Even if local users solve the  commons dilemma they face regarding the optimal provision of the direct  benefit, there might still be a need for introducing mechanisms that  also address the externality that involves those outside of the group.  This paper addresses the analysis of different types of mechanisms,  endogenously emerged from groups vs. externally imposed to them, when  facing the typical tragedy of the commons. During 2000\u20132002 we conducted  a series of economic experiments in several rural communities in  Colombia. The sub-set reported here of 53 sessions with 265 actual users  of local ecosystems, were focused specifically on the effect of  external and self-governing rules for inducing cooperative behavior  within groups. A group extraction or \u2018commons\u2019 game was used to explore  how rules, formal and informal, emerge and how individual behavior  responds to regulatory mechanisms aimed at solving the dilemma. Three  treatments were compared to a baseline design: Two external regulations  (high and low penalties, and only 20% of the players monitored), and a  self-governed system where individuals were allowed to have in each  round a few minutes of non-binding face-to-face communication.  Surprisingly, both external regulations generated very similar results  regardless of the level of the penalty, and they induced behaviors very  similar to those achieved by the self-governed treatment. The  experimental results suggest that individuals do not seem to follow  entirely the conventional economic prediction of a minimizer of expected  costs of regulations against the benefits from over extracting the  resource, and that humans can develop norms based on non-enforceable  rules of cooperation. Instead, other elements related to social norms  and subjective valuation of the benefits and costs of the regulations  might be in play.","1078":"Behavior  in the local commons is usually embedded within a context of  incentives, regulations and social norms for the group of resource  users. Standard environmental economics has tended mostly to focus on  the material incentives and regulations that transform the relative  material costs and benefits of various\/specific\/certain actions.  However, there exist behavioral aspects and social norms that affect how  individuals value material and non-material incentives, and thus  determine their decision to either cooperate or over-extract resources  from a common-pool. This paper discusses the importance of social norms  in shaping behavior in the commons through the lens of experiments\u2014in  particular, experiments conducted in the field with exactly those people  who usually face these social dilemmas in their daily lives. Using a  large sample of experimental sessions inclusive of around one thousand  people, both villagers and students, I test some hypotheses about  behavior in the commons, wherein regulations and social norms constrain  people\u2019s choices. The results suggest that people evaluate several  components of intrinsic and material motivations in deciding whether or  not to cooperate. While responding in the expected direction to an  imperfectly monitored fine for over extraction, the valuation of the  private net cost of violating the regulation is not a sufficient  explanation for participants\u2019 changes in behavior in the experiments.  Even when violations have zero cost, people may react positively to an  external regulator who issues a normative statement about a rule aimed  at solving a particular social dilemma.","1079":"We  use an experimental linear design and a logit probabilistic choice  function to model and estimate agents' concern for resource scarcity.  Although full-appropriation is the dominant strategy of the basic game  whatever the resource size, we expect that if agents exploiting a common  pool resource feel any concern for resource scarcity, they would be  more likely to alter their appropriation strategy the scarcer the  resource stock. Our results show that this expectation holds and  appropriation is restrained when resources are scarce. Further, as this  result could be attributed to both, agents' concern for resource  scarcity and calculation errors in the determination of the  appropriation strategies, we estimate the relevance of both.","1080":"We  model the dynamic effects of external enforcement on the exploitation  of a common pool resource. Fitting our model to experimental data we  find that institutions influence social preferences. We solve two  puzzles in the data: the increase and later erosion of cooperation when  commoners vote against the imposition of a fine, and the high deterrence  power of low fines. When fines are rejected, internalization of a  social norm explains the increased cooperation; violations (accidental  or not), coupled with reciprocal preferences, account for the erosion.  Low fines stabilize cooperation by preventing a spiral of negative  reciprocation.","1081":"We report the results of a new public goods experiment with an  intra-group cooperation dilemma and inter-group competition. In our  design subjects receive information about their relative individual and  group performance after each round with non-incentivized and then  incentivized group competition. We found that, on average, individuals  with low relative performance reduce their contributions to the public  good, but groups with low performance increase theirs. With incentivized  competition, where the relative ranking of the group increases  individual payoffs, the reaction to relative performance is larger with  individuals contributing more to the group; further, we observe that the  variance of strategies decreases as individual and group rankings  increase. These results offer new insights on how social comparison  shapes similar reactions in games with different incentives for group  performance and how competition and cooperation can influence each  other.","1082":"Numerous  studies suggest that communication may be a universal means to mitigate  collective action problems. In this study, we challenge this view and  show that the communication structure crucially determines whether  communication mitigates or intensifies rent-seeking for pure public  goods. We observe the effect of different communication structures in  the context of a finitely repeated intergroup contest and demonstrate  that conflict expenditures are significantly higher if communication is  restricted to one's own group as compared to a situation with no  communication. However, expenditures are significantly lower if open  communication within one's own group and between rivaling groups is  allowed. We show that under open communication intergroup conflicts are  avoided by groups taking turns in winning the contest. Our results do  not only qualify the role of communication for collective action but may  also provide insights on how to mitigate the destructive nature of  intergroup conflict and group rent-seeking.Highlights\u25ba  This paper challenges the role of communication as a universal means to  mitigate collective action problems. \u25ba We show that the communication  structure determines whether communication mitigates or intensifies  rent-seeking for public goods. \u25ba We show that under open communication  intergroup conflicts are avoided by turn taking between groups. \u25ba Our  results may provide insights on how to mitigate the destructive nature  of intergroup conflicts and group rent-seeking.","1083":"nan","1084":"We  test if cooperation is promoted by rank-order competition between  groups in which all groups can be ranked first, i.e. when everyone can  be a winner. This type of rank-order competition has the advantage that  it can eliminate the negative externality a group's performance imposes  on other groups. However, it has the disadvantage that incentives to  outperform others are absent, and therefore it does not eliminate  equilibria where all groups cooperate at an equal but low level. We find  that all-can-win competition produces a universal increase in  cooperation and benefits a majority of individuals if the incentive to  compete is sharp.","1085":"The  use of experimental settings to observe human behaviour in a controlled  environment of incentives, rules and institutions, has been widely used  by the behavioural sciences for sometime now, particularly by  psychology and economics. In most cases the subjects are college  students recruited for one to two hour decision making exercises in  which, depending on their choices, they earn cash averaging US$ 20. In  such exercises players face a set of feasible actions, rules and  incentives (payoffs) involving different forms of social exchange with  other people, and that in most cases involve some kind of externalities  with incomplete contracts, such as in the case of common-pool resources  situations. Depending on the ecological and institutional settings, the  resource users face a set of feasible levels of extraction, a set of  rules regarding the control or monitoring of individual use, and  sometimes ways of imposing material or non-material costs or rewards to  those breaking or following the rules. We brought the experimental lab  to the field and invited about two hundred users of natural resources in  three Colombian rural villages to participate in such decision making  exercises and through these and other research instruments we learned  about the ways they solve - or fail to - tragedies of the commons with  different social institutions.

However, spiteful punishment vanishes if the punishers can  no longer affect the payoff differences between themselves and the  punished individual, whereas the cooperators even increase the resources  devoted to punishment in this case. Our data also discriminate between  different fairness principles. Fairness theories that are based on the  assumption that players compare their own payoff to the group's average  or the group's total payoff cannot explain the fact that cooperators  target their punishment at the defectors. Fairness theories that assume  that players aim to minimize payoff inequalities cannot explain the fact  that cooperators punish defectors even if payoff inequalities cannot be  reduced.

Excludability is particularly effective in  production settings where the average or maximum effort determines team  production. In these settings, we observe almost immediate convergence  to full contribution. In settings where the minimum effort determines  team production, excludability leads to a large increase in  contributions only if the value of the excluded individual's  contribution to the public good is redistributed among the included  individuals.","1118":"Twenty-four  laboratory sessions were conducted to evaluate the roles of  communication and group heterogeneity when voluntary contributions  determine the level of public good provision by small groups of  individuals.

Complex heterogeneity has one individual in  a group having both higher endowment and greater preference for the  public good. Without communication, members of heterogeneous groups tend  to coordinate more on equal contribution shares than predicted by the  conventional public goods model but consistent with a model  incorporating a preference for equity. The distribution of relative  contributions and total payoffs within groups exhibit strong  interactions between communication and heterogeneity, leading to less  equitable distributions of payoffs as heterogeneity becomes more  complex. A model of equity theory helps to organize the results.

Among women, AVP did not significantly modulate the  response to unreciprocated cooperation in either the amygdala or the  anterior insula. However, among men, AVP attenuated the BOLD response to  CD outcomes with human partners across a relatively large cluster  including the amygdala and the anterior insula, which was contrary to  expectations.

We provide experimental evidence for the  behavioral relevance of fairness intentions in this paper. Our main  result indicates that the attribution of fairness intentions is  important in both the domains of negatively and positively reciprocal  behavior. This means that equity models exclusively based on preferences  over the distribution of material payoffs cannot capture reciprocal  behavior.

In particular, there is growing interest in  intranasal OT as a potential treatment for certain psychiatric  disorders, and preliminary pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest  efficacy in alleviating some of the associated symptoms. However, the  vast majority of research participants in these studies have been male,  and there is evidence for sexually differentiated effects of  nonapeptides in both humans and non-human animals. To date, no study has  investigated the effect of intranasal OT on brain function in human  males and females within the same paradigm. Previously, in a randomized,  placebo-controlled, double-blind fMRI study, we reported effects of  intranasal OT and AVP on behavior and brain activity of human males as  they played an interactive social game known as the Prisoner's Dilemma  Game. Here, we present findings from an identical study in human  females, and compare these with our findings from males. Overall, we  find that both behavioral and neural responses to intranasal OT and AVP  are highly sexually differentiated. In women, AVP increased conciliatory  behavior, and both OT and AVP caused women to treat computer partners  more like humans. In men, AVP increased reciprocation of cooperation  from both human and computer partners. However, no specific drug effects  on behavior were shared between men and women. During cooperative  interactions, both OT and AVP increased brain activity in men within  areas rich in OT and AVP receptors and in areas playing a key role in  reward, social bonding, arousal and memory (e.g., the striatum, basal  forebrain, insula, amygdala and hippocampus), whereas OT and AVP either  had no effect or in some cases actually decreased brain activity in  these regions in women. OT treatment rendered neural responses of males  more similar to responses of females in the placebo group and vice  versa, raising the prospect of an inverted u-shaped dose response to  central OT levels. These findings emphasize the need to fully  characterize the effects of intranasal OT and AVP in both males and  females and at multiple doses before widespread clinical application  will be warranted.","1132":"SummaryThe  neural mechanisms supporting social bonds between adult men remain  uncertain.

OT also  enhances left amygdala activation in response to reciprocated  cooperation. Behaviorally, OT was associated with increased rates of  cooperation following unreciprocated cooperation in the previous round  compared with AVP. AVP strongly increased cooperation in response to a  cooperative gesture by the partner compared with both placebo and OT. In  response to reciprocated cooperation, AVP increased activation in a  region spanning known vasopressin circuitry implicated in affiliative  behaviors in other species. Finally, both OT and AVP increase amygdala  functional connectivity with the anterior insula relative to placebo,  which may increase the amygdala's ability to elicit visceral somatic  markers that guide decision making.

However, oxytocin interacted with attachment avoidance-the  tendency to fear dependency and closeness in interpersonal relations.

In the current study, we  investigated if the main findings from our cross-sectional study could  be replicated in a within-subject design using the same paradigm and  whether new findings would emerge. We found OT to attenuate the ventral  tegmental area response to reciprocated cooperation in women, an effect  that is also present in our cross-sectional sample. However, other  cross-sectional findings, especially those found in men, were not  observed in this within-subject study. We hypothesize that the  discrepancy can be explained by differing OT effects based on the degree  of stimulus novelty\/familiarity.

I argue that two properties of  information, replication and high jointness of supply, are crucial for  understanding the nature of the social dilemma in these exchange  systems. Combined with low-cost contributions, these special features of  information can allow social psychological selective incentives to  significantly encourage cooperation. Experiments were conducted to  examine the independent effects of two social psychological selective  incentives (social approval and observational cooperation) on sharing  behavior in a generalized information exchange system. The results  indicate that observing high levels of cooperative behavior is  beneficial in the short run, but ultimately it only leads to moderately  higher levels of cooperation than when individuals cannot observe  cooperative behavior. On the other hand, when individuals receive either  high or low levels of social approval, it has a very positive,  significant impact on cooperative behavior.

In two experiments, group members were more  likely to exit their group and take their resources elsewhere if they  were supervised by an autocratic style leader than by a democratic or  laissez-faire style leader. The destabilizing influence of autocratic  leadership is due to the procedural rather than distributive aspects of  this leadership style: More members exited their group under an  autocratic style leader, relative to a democratic style leader,  regardless of whether or not they received favorable personal outcomes  from the leader. Hence, autocratic leadership is not a stable long-term  solution to the problem of public goods in groups.","1149":"This  experiment investigated potential gender biases in the emergence of  leadership in groups.

Furthermore, during intragroup  competition, a female leader was more instrumental than a male leader in  raising group investments, but this pattern was reversed during  intergroup competition.

Results showed that  biculturals can be primed to express in-group favoritism towards  different ethnic groups, and that this relationship is moderated by the  level of BII-Blendedness in a manner that is consistent with past BII  research. These findings provide empirical support for past discussions  on how biculturals shift between cultural identities, and highlight that  how biculturals feel about their dual identities is an important  influencing factor.","1152":"What  motivates individual self-sacrificial behavior in intergroup conflicts?

The game involves two groups. Each group member is given a  monetary endowment and can decide how much of it to contribute.  Contribution can be made to either of two pools, one that benefits the  in-group at a personal cost and another that, in addition, harms the  out-group. An experiment demonstrated that contributions in the IPD-MD  game are made almost exclusively to the cooperative, within-group pool.  Moreover, preplay intragroup communication increases intragroup  cooperation, but not intergroup competition.

However, despite a growing body  of empirical work, the mechanism underlying such effects is still not  clearly understood. To address this issue the paper explores two kinds  of processes studied by emotion theorists in human\u2013human interaction: inferential processes,  whereby people retrieve information from emotion expressions about  other\u2019s beliefs, desires, and intentions; affective processes, whereby  emotion expressions evoke emotions in others, which then influence their  decisions. To tease apart these two processes as they occur in human\u2013computer interaction, we looked at physiological measures  (electrodermal activity and heart rate deceleration). We present two  experiments where participants engaged in social dilemmas with embodied agents  that expressed emotion. Our results show, first, that people\u2019s  decisions were influenced by affective and cognitive processes and,  according to the prevailing process, people behaved differently and  formed contrasting subjective ratings of the agents; second we show that  an individual trait known as electrodermal lability, which measures  people\u2019s physiological sensitivity, predicted the extent to which  affective or inferential processes dominated the interaction.

In each period, the subjects simultaneously choose  whether or not to make an irreversible contribution to the provision of  an indivisible public good. Subjects observe the past actions of other  subjects if and only if they are connected by the network. Networks may  be incomplete so subjects are asymmetrically informed about the actions  of other subjects in the same network, which is typically an obstacle to  the attainment of an efficient outcome. For all networks, the game has a  large set of (possibly inefficient) equilibrium outcomes. Nonetheless,  the network architecture makes certain strategies salient and  this in turn facilitates coordination on efficient outcomes. In  particular, asymmetries in the network architecture encourage two  salient behaviors, strategic delay and strategic commitment. By  contrast, we find that symmetries in the network architecture can lead  to mis-coordination and inefficient outcomes.Highlights\u25ba  Networks make certain strategies salient and facilitate efficient  outcomes. \u25ba Strategic commitment is observed among  uninformed-and-observed subjects. \u25ba Strategic delay is observed among  informed-and-unobserved subjects. \u25ba Miscoordination tends to arise in  networks where players are symmetrically situated. \u25ba In some networks,  the modal behavior corresponds to what equilibria would predict.","1158":"Charitable  contributions are frequently made over time.

If benefits are shared equally,  individual contributions readily become altruistic, and hence, a social  dilemma arises in which group interests and individual interests oppose  each other. However, contributions to public goods can be self\u2010serving  if each investor gains a disproportionate benefit from its own  contribution. This scenario may hold for our study system, the  interactions of shoaling\u2010unrelated scalefin anthias Pseudanthias squamipinnis  and the ectoparasitic blenny Plagiotremus tapeinosoma .  The blenny bites off pieces of skin, mucus and scales from anthias that  in return may chase the blenny. Chasing the blenny represents a public  good as it makes the parasite change victim species for its next attack.  Laboratory experiments using artificial Plexiglas hosts suggest that  one reason why individuals contribute to the public good is that the  blenny may specialise on non\u2010punishing \u2018free\u2010riders\u2019. Here, we  investigated how far a spatial structure within the shoal and limited  space use by the blenny may contribute to punishment being self\u2010serving.  Field observation reveals that anthias indeed live in spatially  structured groups and that blennies have preferred areas for attacks.  Thus, some anthias individuals are consistently more exposed to blennies  than others and hence may gain disproportional benefits from their  punishment. In conclusion, spatial structure may contribute to the  maintenance of punishment in blenny\u2013anthias interactions even when  groups are large.

We staged an experimental social-dilemma game in  which actors could pay to conceal information about their contribution,  giving, and punishing decisions from an observer who selects her future  social partners from the actors. The observer could pay to conceal her  observation of the actors. We found sophisticated dynamic strategies on  either side. Actors hide their severe punishment and low contributions  but display high contributions. Observers select high contributors as  social partners; remarkably, punishment behavior seems irrelevant for  qualifying as a social partner.

Moral Foundations Theory has  proven to be a useful means of categorizing ideas about morality and  predicting opinions on aspects of social justice, political orientation,  and other constructs related to prosocial behavior.

The results indicated no relationship between  Progressivism and performance in the Thieves' Game.

Because  discussion about the upcoming dilemma allows participants to make  promises and creates group solidarity, the 2 explanations are often  confounded. This paper aims to clarify past results by having  participants engage in an unrelated discussion prior to a dilemma  interaction. We find that solidarity effects can be induced by minimal  group categorizations, but are relatively weak. Discussions involving  consequential but unrelated coordination tasks are shown to prime  cooperative norms and increase cooperation with both in\u2010group and  out\u2010group members. Our findings suggest that cheap talk may work for  even cheaper reasons than previously thought.   ","1184":"This  paper analyzes the impact of inequality in the distribution of  endowments on cooperation. We conduct a lab experiment using a dynamic  Public Good Game to test this relation. We introduce the possibility of  choosing among three different redistribution rules: Equidistribution,  Proportional to contribution and Progressive to endowment. This novelty  in a dynamic environment allows us to analyze how the inequality within  groups changes according to individual choices and to investigate if  players show inequity averse preferences. Results show that inequality  has a negative impact on individual contribution. Players act in order  to reduce the initial exogenous inequality. Indeed, in the Treatment  with the highest level of inequality, agents vote for reducing the  endowment heterogeneity. Moreover, individual contribution is strongly  influenced by others\u2019 contributions.","1185":"This  paper uses a two-person linear voluntary contribution mechanism with  stochastic marginal benefits from a public good to examine the effect of  imperfect information on contributions.

Moreover, the results support the interpretation  that subjects bid \u201cas if\u201d they were risk averse, and suggest that \u201cas  if\u201d risk-averse behavior is negatively correlated with willingness to  contribute.","1186":"previous research indicates that risky and uncertainmarginal returns from a public good lower contribu-tions signi\ufb01cantly. this paper presents experimental re-sults showing that this effect depends on the employedparameterization.","1187":"Examined  the power-inversion effect as it relates to both the truel, i.e., a  3-person duel, and the triadic coalition-formation situation. 4  conditions were examined: (1) a deterministic truel which allowed  coalitions, (2) a deterministic truel which did not allow coalitions,  (3) a probabilistic truel which allowed coalitions, and (4) a  probabilistic truel which did not allow coalitions. The main hypothesis  was that the power-inversion effect would be replaced by the \"strength\"  effect in the probabilistic coalition-formation situation. It was also  predicted that the power-inversion effect would be observed in the truel  situations in which no coalitions were allowed to form and in the  deterministic coalition-formation situation. Results support the main  hypothesis. However, the support was weakened by the fact that the  power-inversion effect was not observed in the deterministic  coalition-formation situation.

The  reciprocal trust players develop during the first game is thought to  mediate transfer of learning effects. Recently, a computational  cognitive model using a novel trust mechanism has been shown to account  for human behavior in both games, including the transfer between games.  We present the results of a study in which we evaluate the model's a priori  predictions of human learning and transfer in 16 different conditions.  The model's predictive validity is compared against five model variants  that lacked a trust mechanism. The results suggest that a trust  mechanism is necessary to explain human behavior across multiple  conditions, even when a human plays against a non-human agent. The  addition of a trust mechanism to the other learning mechanisms within  the cognitive architecture, such as sequence learning, instance-based  learning, and utility learning, leads to better prediction of the  empirical data. It is argued that computational cognitive modeling is a  useful tool for studying trust development, calibration, and repair.","1190":"Few  interpersonal relationships endure without one party violating the  other's expectations. Thus, the ability to build trust and to restore  cooperation after a breach can be critical for the preservation of  positive relationships. Using an iterated prisoner's dilemma, this  article presents two experiments that investigated the effects of the  timing of a trust breach\u2014at the start of an interaction, after 5 trials,  after 10 trials, or not at all. The findings indicate that getting off on the wrong foot has  devastating long-term consequences. Although later breaches seemed to  limit cooperation for only a short time, they still planted a seed of  distrust that surfaced in the end.","1191":"The  evolution of cooperation in network-structured populations has been a  major focus of theoretical work in recent years. When players are  embedded in fixed networks, cooperators are more likely to interact  with, and benefit from, other cooperators. In theory, this clustering  can foster cooperation on fixed networks under certain circumstances.  Laboratory experiments with humans, however, have thus far found no  evidence that fixed network structure actually promotes cooperation.  Here, we provide such evidence and help to explain why others failed to  find it. First, we show that static networks can lead to a stable high  level of cooperation, outperforming well-mixed populations. We then  systematically vary the benefit that cooperating provides to one\u2019s  neighbors relative to the cost required to cooperate (b\/c), as well as the average number of neighbors in the network (k). When b\/c &gt; k, we observe high and stable levels of cooperation. Conversely, when b\/c \u2264 k  or players are randomly shuffled, cooperation decays. Our results are  consistent with a quantitative evolutionary game theoretic prediction  for when cooperation should succeed on networks and, for the first time  to our knowledge, provide an experimental demonstration of the power of  static network structure for stabilizing human cooperation.","1192":"Previous  work has demonstrated that Social Value Orientation (SVO) is related to  cooperative behavior in social dilemmas. However, little is known  concerning the underlying processes. In two eye-tracking studies  investigating decisions in money allocation tasks (Experiment 1) and  Public Good Dilemmas (Experiment 2), we show that differences in SVO are  accompanied by consistent differences in information search. Decision  time, number of fixations, the proportion of inspected information, the  degree of attention towards the others\u2019 payoffs, and the number of  transitions from and towards others\u2019 payoffs gradually increase with  absolute SVO deviation from a pure selfish orientation. Overall these  effects seem to be similar for individuals caring positively (i.e.,  cooperative) or negatively (i.e., competitive) about others. The fact  that changes are gradual instead of abrupt indicates that differences in  SVO seem to be related to gradual changes in weights given to outcomes  for self and others.Highlights\u25ba  Information search and processing varies as a function of Social Value  Orientation. \u25ba An increase in deviation from pure individualists comes  along with an increase in information search. \u25ba Differences are observed  in simple distribution tasks &amp; complex strategic decisions.","1193":"['experimental', 'research', 'game', 'environments', 'involves', 'naive', 'subjects', 'generally', 'good', 'reason', 'experiences', 'subject', 'experimentation', 'likely', 'influence', 'his', 'behavior', 'he', 'again', 'contaminate', 'addition', 'variable', 'usually', 'investigation', 'experience', 'ought', 'another', 'matter', 'major', 'considering', 'presumably', 'enhance', 'probability', 'rational', 'maximize', 'one', 'utility', 'function', 'maximizes', 'expected', 'more', 'encounters', 'environment', 'able', 'extract', 'time', 'think', 'appropriate', 'obtain', 'work', 'done', 'look', 'effect', 'future', 'interpersonal', 'conflict', 'resolution', 'two', 'forms']","1194":"['three', 'kinds', '2', 'person', 'zero', 'sum', 'games', 'utilized', 'two', 'employed', 'matrix', 'competitive', 'strategy', 'dominate', 'formal', 'sense', 'whereas', 'third', 'involved', 'dilemma', 'variety', 'neither', 'first', 'difference', 'subjects', 'collaborative', 'behavior', 'experimental', 'conditions', 'regardless', 'condition', 'manifested', 'more', 'collaboration', 'true', 'identical', 'matrices', 'pairs', 'selected', 'own', 'strategies', 'game', 'pronounced', 'half', 'exposed', 'initially', 'stooge', 'contrast', 'almost', 'complete', 'absence', 'played', 'latter', 'group', 'playing', 'same', 'author']","1195":"The  role of risk taking in building trust relations has largely been  overlooked in the burgeoning literature on trust in the social sciences;  yet it is central to understanding how trust develops. We argue that a  series of risk-taking behaviors is indispensable to building a trust  relation. We conducted experiments in Japan and the United States to  examine the independent and cross-cultural effects of risk taking on  trust building. The results of these experiments indicate that the  American participants took more risks than did the Japanese, supporting  the general claim that Americans are inclined toward risk taking and  trust building. Even so, the Americans were no better than the Japanese  at improving the level of cooperation. The cumulative results of these  experiments imply that risk taking is a critical element in trust  building for Americans, but less so for the Japanese. Our results show  clearly that it is important to distinguish trusting behavior from  cooperation and to measure them separately if we are to study trust and  trust building in relation to social cooperation.","1196":" Abstract      We study the effect of communication in an experimental game where cooperation is consistent with equilibrium play if players share an understanding that cheating will be punished.

The presence of multiple public goods makes  coordination among participants more difficult, discouraging donor  participation and decreasing the likelihood of any public good being  effectively funded. Applied to the case of fundraising, the results show  how overall donations and the number of effectively funded projects may  both decrease as the total number of projects vying for funding  increases. The analysis considers whether making one of the contribution  options salient, either through its merits or by arbitrarily choosing  one to feature during the experiment, helps overcome the increased  coordination problem. The results have implications for the growing  popularity of crowdfunding websites, and suggest benefits to these sites  from helping donors compare and identify the most promising projects.","1199":"This  paper considers how six alternative rebate rules affect voluntary  contributions in a threshold public-good experiment. The rules differ by  (1) whether an individual can receive a proportional rebate of excess  contributions, a winner-takes-all of any excess contributions, or a full  rebate of one's contribution in the event the public good is provided  and excess contributions exist, and (2) whether the probability of  receiving a rebate is proportional to an individual's contribution  relative to total contributions or is a simple uniform probability  distribution set by the number of contributors. The paper adds to the  existing experimental economics literature on threshold public goods by  investigating both aggregate and individual demand revelation under the  winner-take-all and random full-rebate rules. Half of the rules  (proportional rebate, winner-take-all with uniform probability among all group members, and random full-rebate with uniform probability) provide total contributions that nearly equal total benefits, while the rest (winner-take-all with proportional probability, winner-take-all with uniform probability among contributors only, and random full-rebate with proportional  probability) exceed benefits by over 30%. Only the proportional rebate  rule is found to achieve both aggregate and individual demand  revelation. Our experimental results have implications for both  fundraisers and valuation practitioners.","1200":"The  current social dilemma literature lacks theoretical consensus regarding  how individuals behave when facing multiple simultaneous social  dilemmas. The divided-loyalty hypothesis, from organizational theory,  predicts that cooperation will decline as individuals experience  multiple social dilemmas with different compared to the same group  members.

We employ a laboratory experiment to create consensus  between these literatures and find support for the  conditional-cooperation hypothesis. The positive effect of interacting  with different group members comes from participants having an  opportunity to shift their cooperative behavior from the less  cooperative to the more cooperative group.","1201":"This  paper reports an experiment investigating how assignments improve  economic efficiency in a modified version of the standard  voluntary-contributions mechanism.

This is the question we address with an experiment.

We find that  it is not. An examination of the Big-5 personality predictors of each  behavior reinforces this result: they are different. In short, knowing  how pro-social individuals are with respect to fellow group members does  not help predict their parochialism.","1203":"Bridging  the literatures on social dilemmas, intergroup conflict, and social  hierarchy, the authors systematically varied the intergroup context in  which social dilemmas were embedded to investigate how costly  contributions to public goods influence status conferral. They predicted  that contribution behavior would have opposite effects on 2 forms of  status\u2014prestige and dominance\u2014depending on its consequences for the  self, in-group and out-group members. When the only way to benefit  in-group members was by harming out-group members (Study 1),  contributions increased prestige and decreased dominance, compared with  free-riding. Adding the option of benefitting in-group members without  harming out-group members (Study 2) decreased the prestige and increased  the dominance of those who chose to benefit in-group members via  intergroup competition. Finally, sharing resources with both in-group  and out-group members decreased perceptions of both prestige and  dominance, compared with sharing them with in-group members only (Study  3). Prestige and dominance differentially mediated the effects of  contribution behavior on leader election, exclusion from the group, and  choices of a group representative for an intergroup competition. Taken  together, these findings show that the well-established relationship  between contribution and status is moderated by both the intergroup  context and the conceptualization of status.

The other  two mechanisms serve as controls for examining the extent to which the  allocator mechanism affects provision of the CPR. The tremble mechanism  randomly divides the CPR between group members using the same division  rules as the allocator mechanism. The egalitarian mechanism divides the  CPR equally between group members. Provision of the CPR does not decay  over time and is significantly closer to the group's socially optimal  level under the allocator mechanism than under the tremble and  egalitarian mechanisms.

People are reluctant to contribute information  because they save time, effort and perhaps social power if they withhold  their knowledge and socially loaf. But if all people choose this  individually efficient strategy, then no information exchange can take  place, and the group is less effective than it would have been if all  members contributed. Thus, in the knowledge\u2010exchange situation, group  norms and individual norms oppose each other. In order to strengthen people's orientation towards the  group, virtual collaborative tools sometimes provide member portraits.  But based on the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effect  (SIDE)\u2010Model, ambivalent effects of these member portraits are expected  according to people's social categorization: when people identify more  strongly with the group, such portraits enhance participation, whereas  when people have a stronger individual identity, they undermine  participation. This study links the concepts of social value orientation  to identity salience. The assumption is that in the  information\u2010exchange dilemma, the social value orientation of a group  member will determine whether group identity or individual identity  becomes salient for that group member. We then extend the SIDE\u2010model to  the domain of social loafing and expect that portraits of the group  members will have different effects for people with individual  orientation and for people with prosocial orientation. An experiment  confirmed this expectation and revealed a significant interaction  between social value orientation and portraits. Especially striking is  the result that for prosocials the provision of member portraits leads  to an increase in social loafing. This is analogous to the predictions  of the SIDE\u2010model.

The unexpected  empirical outcomes for the repeated PD game, that cooperation actually  decreased when the participants had the option of using a costly  punishment strategy and that participants who used costly punishment in  some round of the repeated game often did so in the first round, are  discussed in terms of differences in attitudes toward reputation in  Chinese culture compared to other locations (mostly in Western society)  where similar experiments have been conducted. The second experiment  models an institution providing incentives to increase contribution  levels (i.e., cooperation) to the public good.

This article also relates the  concept of trust to perceptions of fairness and collective efficacy.  Finally, some empirical evidence is presented to test these assumptions.  Results show that trust seems, indeed, to have an effect on people's  experiences of fear and, even more importantly, the power of trust to  reduce fear seems to be strongly related to perceptions of fairness and  collective efficacy.","1260":"This  study advanced a social dilemma analysis to examine the role of  self-interested and prosocial concerns in the approval of a real-life  structural solution: the privatization of the British national railway  system in 1996. As predicted, disapproval of privatizing this public  good increased when people were more concerned about the transition  costs of privatization, and about how privatization would affect their  personal outcomes (e.g., travel convenience) and the outcomes for the  collective (e.g., railway accessibility). Moreover, the approval of  privatization among people guided primarily by their self-interest  (i.e., pro-self individuals) was influenced more strongly by personal  outcome concerns. Contrary to hypothesis, however, prosocial  individuals' approval of privatization was not influenced more strongly  by collective outcome concerns. Finally, people who disapproved of  privatization also exhibited a weaker intention to travel by train in  the future, an indication that the willingness to engage in collectively  desirable behavior may decrease when people fail to endorse a  structural solution.","1261":"  Abstract  The present experiment examined whether leaders high in  charisma are able to motivate decision\u2010makers to cooperate more in a  public goods dilemma. On the basis of charismatic leadership theories,  it was expected that a charismatic leader would be able to transform  people's motives beyond self\u2010interest, consequently increasing  cooperation. This transformation effect was expected to occur among  individuals aimed at maximizing their own self\u2010interest (i.e.,  pro\u2010selfs), but not among those aimed at maximizing joint or collective  outcomes (i.e., pro\u2010socials). Furthermore, leader's charisma was  experimentally manipulated by means of describing the leader as either  self\u2010sacrificing or benefiting. The results revealed that  self\u2010sacrificing leaders, contrary to benefiting leaders, were perceived  as more charismatic and were able to motivate decision\u2010makers to  cooperate more. The latter effect appeared to be more pronounced among  pro\u2010selfs rather than pro\u2010socials, as such supporting the  transformational idea of charismatic leaders.

Why and under which circumstances do we attribute human-like  properties to machines? Although humans increasingly interact directly  with machines it remains unclear whether humans implicitly attribute  intentions to them and, if so, whether such interactions resemble  human-human interactions on a neural level. In social cognitive  neuroscience the ability to attribute intentions and desires to others  is being referred to as having a Theory of Mind (ToM). With the present  study we investigated whether an increase of human-likeness of  interaction partners modulates the participants' ToM associated cortical  activity.   Methodology\/Principal Findings By  means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (subjects n\u200a=\u200a20) we  investigated cortical activity modulation during highly interactive  human-robot game. Increasing degrees of human-likeness for the game  partner were introduced by means of a computer partner, a functional  robot, an anthropomorphic robot and a human partner. The classical  iterated prisoner's dilemma game was applied as experimental task which  allowed for an implicit detection of ToM associated cortical activity.  During the experiment participants always played against a random  sequence unknowingly to them. Irrespective of the surmised interaction  partners' responses participants indicated having experienced more fun  and competition in the interaction with increasing human-like features  of their partners. Parametric modulation of the functional imaging data  revealed a highly significant linear increase of cortical activity in  the medial frontal cortex as well as in the right temporo-parietal  junction in correspondence with the increase of human-likeness of the  interaction partner (computer&lt;functional robot&lt;anthropomorphic  robot&lt;human).   Conclusions\/Significance Both  regions correlating with the degree of human-likeness, the medial  frontal cortex and the right temporo-parietal junction, have been  associated with Theory-of-Mind. The results demonstrate that the  tendency to build a model of another's mind linearly increases with its  perceived human-likeness. Moreover, the present data provides first  evidence of a contribution of higher human cognitive functions such as  ToM in direct interactions with artificial robots. Our results shed  light on the long-lasting psychological and philosophical debate  regarding human-machine interaction and the question of what makes  humans being perceived as human.

Across a field  survey of working adults and in a lab experiment, individuals with a  strong moral identity were less likely to act in self-interest, yet  individuals with a weak moral identity were more likely to act in  self-interest, when subjectively experiencing power. Finally, we predict  and demonstrate an explanatory mechanism behind this effect: The  psychological experience of power enhances moral awareness among those  with a strong moral identity, yet decreases the moral awareness among  those with a weak moral identity. In turn, individuals' moral awareness  affects how they behave in relation to their self-interest.

In Experiment  2, participants primed with high power were more likely to act against  an annoying stimulus (a fan) in the environment, suggesting that the  experience of power leads to the performance of goal-directed behavior.

Although little is know about the neural  substrates that support cooperative over noncooperative behaviors,  recent research has shown that mutually cooperative behavior in the  context of a mixed-motive game, the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), is  associated with increased neural activity within reinforcement  circuitry. Other research attests to a role for serotonin in the  modulation of social behavior and in reward processing. In this study,  we used a within-subject, crossover, double-blind design to investigate  performance of an iterated, sequential PD game for monetary reward by  healthy human adult participants following ingestion of an amino-acid  drink that either did (T+) or did not (T\u2212) contain l-tryptophan.  Tryptophan depletion produced significant reductions in the level of  cooperation shown by participants when playing the game on the first,  but not the second, study days. This effect was accompanied by a  significantly diminished probability of cooperative responding given  previous mutually cooperative behavior. These data suggest that  serotonin plays a significant role in the acquisition of socially  cooperative behavior in human adult participants, and suggest novel  hypotheses concerning the serotonergic modulation of reward information  in socially cooperative behavior in both health and psychiatric illness.","1297":" Shame  is considered a social emotion with action tendencies that elicit  socially beneficial behavior.

Based on the affect as information theory, we  hypothesize that incidental feelings of shame can increase cooperation,  but only for self-interested individuals, and only in a context where  shame is relevant with regards to its action tendency. To test this  hypothesis, cooperation levels are compared between a simultaneous  prisoner's dilemma (where \u201cdefect\u201d may result from multiple motives) and  a sequential prisoner's dilemma (where \u201csecond player defect\u201d is the  result of intentional greediness). As hypothesized, shame positively  affected proselfs in a sequential prisoner's dilemma. Hence ashamed  proselfs become inclined to cooperate when they believe they have no way  to hide their greediness, and not necessarily because they want to make  up for earlier wrong-doing.

As the overall benefit outweighs  the harm incurred, provision may lead to Pareto improvement if the gains  from cooperation are used to compensate the harmed parties. Such  situations are ubiquitous, e.g., in not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) problems.  We study experimentally voluntary contributions to Potential Pareto  Public Goods, in which provision is efficient but harms a minority in  the group. We test the effects of punishment and reward institutions,  with and without communication. We find that contributions to Potential  Pareto Public Goods are not viewed as unequivocally socially desirable  and do not increase with communication or punishment. With the reward  institution, communication facilitates compensation, undoing the harm  imposed on the minority player by majority contributions. Consequently,  contributions are no longer viewed as socially undesirable, and majority  contributions increase. Taken together, our results establish that  perceptions and behavior in voluntary contributions to Potential Pareto  Public Goods are dramatically different than with universal public goods  that benefit all members of the community.

However, often \u2013 such as when agents are  heterogeneous \u2013 there is a trade-off between efficiency and equality.

We provide evidence for this from a  public good experiment using a simple mechanism which allows individuals  to communicate periodically with other group members and reward them  for their actions. We show that, in homogeneous populations \u2013 where  there is no tension between efficiency and equality \u2013 the mechanism  permits group to obtain maximum efficiency. This is not the case in  heterogeneous populations where individuals derive different benefits  from cooperation. Although almost all heterogeneous groups agree to  follow specific contribution rules with positive contributions, most of  them either prioritize equality over efficiency or strike a compromise  between the two. These findings suggest that equality concerns can  impose limits on the ability of heterogeneous populations to reach  efficient outcomes through self-governance.

Provision has negative downstream externalities: contributions hurt  agents outside the in-group (\u201cOutsiders\u201d), rendering them anti-social.  Many models of social preferences  predict that such externalities should reduce provision, although  conditional cooperation or a preference for in-group members may  counteract this. We test this model with a lab experiment using  Outsiders with whom the in-group members have more and less contact.  With homogeneous in-group benefits, the presence of negative downstream  externalities reduces contributions by half when they have closer  contact with Outsiders but not at all when they have had no contact. We  introduce a rotating high-return position that allows subjects to trade  favors. In this setting, contributions of non-privileged members  diminish slightly when faced with the negative externality given closer  contact with Outsiders, and not at all with less contact.

It is not yet well-understood how these fit together to  affect behavior, how they interact in various institutional structures,  and how they play out over time. We use a laboratory experiment to study  the elements and dynamics of favor trading in a particular setting: the  private provision of a public good. In our experiment, giving subjects  the ability to practice targeted reciprocity by making a simple,  low-cost change in information provision increases contributions to the  public good by 14\u00a0%. Subjects reward group members who have  previously been generous to them and withhold rewards from ungenerous  group members. Strategic concerns cannot explain all of this behavior,  and it must be at least partly due to direct reciprocity. When someone  cannot directly benefit from favor trading, he gives much less to the  public good.

In all  experiment sessions, no intervention occurs in the first seven and last  seven rounds, allowing us to examine the effects of introducing and  taking away a policy. The subsidy leads to near-efficient extraction,  but surprisingly leads groups that were not over-extracting to also  reduce extraction. This over-compliance decreases efficiency, although  on net the subsidy is the most efficiency-enhancing intervention.  Information provision, communication, normative appeals, and normative  appeals combined with communication all reduce over-extraction (though  by less than the subsidy) without exacerbating over-compliance; however,  the effects of information alone and communication alone are small and  not robust. The non-price policies cause a decline in over-extraction of  from 0.549 (information) to 11.441\u00a0% (normative appeals with  communication). These effects are of the same order of magnitude as the  effects seen in major field studies of conservation messaging.

In four studies (N\u00a0=\u00a0693),  we tested the hypothesis that a physiological marker of deficient  glucose use (i.e., type 2 diabetic symptoms) relates to less  forgiveness. Higher type 2 diabetic symptoms correlated negatively with a  dispositional tendency to forgive others (Study 1) and correlated  positively with unforgiving motivations toward hypothetical  transgressors (Study 2) and actual transgressors (Study 3). Diabetic  symptoms correlated negatively with cooperative behavior in the  Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma Game (Study 4).

The effect  arose at the intensive margin and with repetition. Those who contributed  contributed more in larger groups. Larger and smaller groups had  similar initial contribution levels, but cooperation rates declined more  slowly in the larger groups.

It has been  argued that centralized punishment institutions can overcome the  detrimental effects of peer-punishment. However, this argument  presupposes the existence of a legitimate authority and leaves an  unresolved gap in the transition from peer-punishment to centralized  punishment. Here we show that the origins of centralized punishment  could lie in individuals\u2019 distinct ability to punish defectors. In our  laboratory experiment, we vary the structure of the punishment situation  to disentangle the effects of punitive preferences, monetary incentives  and individual punishment costs on the punishment of defectors. We find  that actors tacitly coordinate on the strongest group member to punish  defectors, even if the strongest individual incurs a net loss from  punishment. Such coordination leads to a more effective and more  efficient provision of a cooperative environment than we observe in  groups of all equals. Our results show that even an arbitrary assignment  of an individual to a focal position in the social hierarchy can  trigger the endogenous emergence of more centralized forms of  punishment.","1317":"A  vast amount of empirical and theoretical research on public good games  indicates that the threat of punishment can curb free-riding in human  groups engaged in joint enterprises. Since punishment is often costly,  however, this raises an issue of second-order free-riding: indeed, the  sanctioning system itself is a common good which can be exploited. Most  investigations, so far, considered peer punishment: players could impose  fines on those who exploited them, at a cost to themselves. Only a  minority considered so-called pool punishment. In this scenario, players  contribute to a punishment pool before engaging in the joint  enterprise, and without knowing who the free-riders will be. Theoretical  investigations (Sigmund et al., Nature 466:861\u2013863, 2010)  have shown that peer punishment is more efficient, but pool punishment  more stable. Social learning, i.e., the preferential imitation of  successful strategies, should lead to pool punishment if sanctions are  also imposed on second-order free-riders, but to peer punishment if they  are not. Here we describe an economic experiment (the Mutual Aid game)  which tests this prediction. We find that pool punishment only emerges  if second-order free riders are punished, but that peer punishment is  more stable than expected. Basically, our experiment shows that social  learning can lead to a spontaneously emerging social contract, based on a  sanctioning institution to overcome the free rider problem.","1318":"Norm  violations can be contagious. Previous research analyzed two mechanisms  of why knowledge about others\u2019 norm violations triggers its spread: (1)  actors lower their subjective beliefs about the probability or severity  of punishment or (2) they condition their compliance on others\u2019  compliance. While earlier field studies could hardly disentangle both  effects, we use a laboratory experiment which eliminates any punishment  threat. Subjects (n\u2009=\u2009466) can throw a die and are paid according to  their reported number. Our design rules out any possibility of personal  identification so that subjects can lie about their thrown number and  claim inflated payoffs without risking detection. The aggregate  distribution of reported payoffs allows the estimation of the extent to  which the honesty norm is violated. We compare two treatment conditions  in which subjects are informed about lying behavior of others with a  control condition without information feedback. Observations from a  subsequent die throw reveal that knowledge about liars triggers the  spread of lying compared to the control condition. Results from a  follow-up experiment show that this effect is moderated by subjects\u2019  beliefs about the prevalence of norm violations of others. Our results  demonstrate the contagiousness of norm violations, where actors imitate  norm violations of others under the exclusion of strategic motives.","1319":"This  study examined whether blushing after a sociomoral transgression  remediates trustworthiness in an interdependent context.

In SPG  situations it is thus only rational for any group member to contribute  if according to the beliefs of that group member her contribution is  essential to the production of the public good. An individual's estimate  of the impact of their contribution on the likelihood of public good  production is known as their efficacy. The classic efficacy \u2013 cooperation hypothesis holds that individuals will be more likely to contribute if they estimate their contributions to be more necessary. Based on a game theoretical analysis of the SPG game, we contribute to the literature by identifying two distinct components of efficacy, viz. material efficacy and contextual efficacy.  The former is based on objective characteristics of group members (such  as resources, power, or skill) and the latter on beliefs about the  material efficacy of other group members and expectations concerning  their behavior. We present evidence from three experimental studies,  showing how information on the distribution of material efficacy in the  group can break the monotone material efficacy \u2013 cooperation relation.  In addition, contrary to what one would expect based on both the  efficacy \u2013 cooperation hypothesis and game theory,  our results show that the effects of material efficacy are not mediated  by contextual efficacy, both forms of efficacy having significant  effects on behavior.","1322":"Encouraging  cooperation among selfish individuals is crucial in many real-world  systems, where individuals\u2019 collective behaviors can be analyzed using  evolutionary public goods game. Along this line, extensive studies have  shown that reputation is an effective mechanism to investigate the  evolution of cooperation. In most existing studies, participating  individuals in a public goods game are assumed to contribute  unconditionally into the public pool, or they can choose partners based  on a common reputation standard (e.g., preferences or characters).  However, to assign one reputation standard for all individuals is  impractical in many real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce a  reputation tolerance mechanism that allows an individual to select its  potential partners and decide whether or not to contribute an investment  to the public pool based on its tolerance to other individuals\u2019  reputation. Specifically, an individual takes part in a public goods  game only if the number of participants with higher reputation exceeds  the value of its tolerance. Moreover, in this paper, an individual\u2019s  reputation can increase or decrease in a bounded interval based on its  historical behaviors. We explore the principle that how the reputation  tolerance and conditional investment mechanisms can affect the evolution  of cooperation in spatial lattice networks. Our simulation results  demonstrate that a larger tolerance value can achieve an environment  that promote the cooperation of participants.

This situation, described as the \u201cpublic goods dilemma\u201d  in game theory, makes the ubiquity of cooperation a major evolutionary  puzzle. Despite this generalization, the demonstration of genetic  background and fitness effects of the public goods dilemma has been  limited to interactions between viruses and between cells, and thus its  relevance at higher levels of organismal complexity is still largely  unexplored. Here we provide experimental evidence for the public goods  dilemma in a social insect, the ant Pristomyrmex punctatus. In  this species, all workers are involved in both asexual reproduction and  cooperative tasks. Genetic cheaters infiltrate field colonies,  reproducing more than the workers but shunning cooperative tasks. In  laboratory experiments, cheaters outcompeted coexisting workers in both  survival and reproduction, although a group composed only of cheaters  failed to produce offspring. The operations of the public goods dilemma  in P. punctatus showed a remarkable convergence with those in  microbial societies, not only in fitness consequences but also in  behavioral mechanisms.

Self-regarding models that are based on Nash equilibrium (NE) strategies  or evolutionary game dynamics correctly predict which incentives are  best at promoting cooperation, but individuals do not play these  rational strategies overall. The goal of our study is to investigate the  dynamics of human decision making in the repeated PGG with  institutional incentives. We consider that an individual\u2019s contribution  is affected by four factors, which are self-interest, the behavior of  others, the reaction to rewards and the reaction to punishment. We find  that people on average do not react to rewards and punishment and that  self-interest and the behavior of others sufficiently explain the  dynamics of human behavior. Further analysis suggests that institutional  incentives promote cooperation by affecting the self-regarding  preference and that the other-regarding preference seems to be  independent of incentive schemes. Because individuals do not change  their behavioral patterns even if they were not rewarded or punished,  the mere potential to punish defectors and reward cooperators can lead  to considerable increases in the level of cooperation.","1330":"We  have carried out a comparative analysis of data collected in three  experiments on Prisoner's Dilemmas on lattices available in the  literature.

Differences from NE behavior have also been  observed in PGG experiments that include incentives to cooperate,  especially when these are peer-incentives administered by the players  themselves. In our repeated PGG experiment, an institution rewards and  punishes individuals based on their contributions. The primary  experimental result is that institutions which both reward and punish  (IRP) promote cooperation significantly better than either institutions  which only punish (IP) or which only reward (IR) and that IP has  contribution levels significantly above IR. Although comparing their  single-round NE strategies correctly predicts which incentives are best  at promoting cooperation, individuals do not play these strategies  overall. Our analysis shows that other intrinsic motivations that  combine conforming behavior with reactions to being rewarded\/punished  provide a better explanation of observed outcomes. In our experiments,  some individuals who display more cooperation than other individuals can  be regarded as the exemplars (or leaders). The role of these exemplars  in promoting cooperation provides important insights into understanding  cooperation in PGG and the effectiveness of institutional incentives at  promoting desirable societal behavior.","1332":"<jats:p>In a globalized world, establishing successful cooperation between people from different nations is becoming increasingly important.

In interactions involving mutual knowledge about only the other players\u2019 nationalities, we demonstrate that people hold strong and transnationally shared expectations (i.e., stereotypes) concerning the cooperation level of interaction partners from other countries. These expectations are the strongest determinants of participant cooperation. Paradoxically, however, they turn out to be incorrect stereotypes that even correlate negatively with reality. In addition to erroneous expectations, participants\u2019 cooperation behavior is driven by (shared) social preferences that vary according to the interaction partner\u2019s nationality. In the cross-societal context, these social preferences are influenced by differences in wealth and ingroup favoritism, as well as effects of specific country combinations but not by spatial distance between nations.<\/jats:p>","1333":"In  reasoning about strategic interpersonal situations, such as in playing  games, an individual's representation of the situation often includes  not only information about the goals and rules of the game, but also a  mental model of other minds.

Specifically, we test whether  ingroup favoritism is a fixed phenomenon that can be observed from the  very beginning and remains stable over time, or whether it develops  (increases vs. decreases) during repeated contact. Ingroup favoritism is  assessed through cooperation behavior in a repeated continuous  prisoner's dilemma where participants sequentially interact with 10  members of the ingroup (own city and university) and subsequently with  10 members of the outgroup (other city and university), or vice versa.  In none of the experiments do we observe initial differences in  cooperation behavior for interaction partners from the ingroup, as  compared to outgroup, and we only observe small differences in  expectations regarding the interaction partners' cooperation behavior.  After repeated interaction, however, including a change of groups, clear  ingroup favoritism can be observed. Instead of being due to gradual and  potentially biased updating of expectations, we found that these  emerging differences were mainly driven by the change of interaction  partners' group membership that occurred after round 10. This indicates  that in social dilemma settings ingroup favoritism is to some degree  dynamic in that it is enhanced and sometimes only observable if group  membership is activated by thinking about both the interaction with the  ingroup and the outgroup.","1337":"Cooperation  among unrelated individuals can arise if decisions to help others can  be based on reputation. While working for dyadic interactions,  reputation-use in social dilemmas involving many individuals (e.g.  public goods games) becomes increasingly difficult as groups become  larger and errors more frequent. Reputation is therefore believed to  have played a minor role for the evolution of cooperation in collective  action dilemmas such as those faced by early humans. Here, we show in  computer simulations that a reputation system based on punitive actions  can overcome these problems and, compared to reputation system based on  generous actions, (i) is more likely to lead to the evolution of  cooperation in sizable groups, (ii) more effectively sustains  cooperation within larger groups, and (iii) is more robust to errors in  reputation assessment.

Experiment 1 manipulated whether  negotiators stood face-to-face or side-by-side (unable to see each  other) in a simulated strike negotiation. Face-to-face dyads were more  likely to coordinate on a settlement early in the strike, resulting in  higher joint gains. An alternative interpretation in terms of an  anticipatory effect of face-to-face contact was not supported.  Experiment 2 manipulated whether previously unacquainted negotiators  conversed face-to-face or by telephone before separating to play a  conflict game with the structure of a Prisoner's Dilemma game.  Face-to-face dyads were more likely to coordinate on high joint gain  outcomes. The facilitatory effect of face-to-face contact was  statistically mediated by a measure of dyadic rapport.

We concentrate on two specific emotions: anger  and happiness. Our findings provide clear evidence that measures of  social preferences are sensitive to subjects' current emotional states.

The main reason for these results is the  different externalities contributions have on the other group members\u2019  payoffs affecting individuals\u2019 willingness to cooperate.

Similarly, a precedent for inefficient play in the repeated Prisoner\u2019s  Dilemma game does not extend to the repeated Stag Hunt game.

The essays and evaluations, read by the participant, were designed to  induce either anger, sympathy, or a neutral emotional response toward  the confederate with whom they would then play the social exchange  games. Galvanic skin conductance level (SCL) showed enhanced  physiological arousal during anger induction compared to both the  neutral and sympathy conditions. In both social exchange games,  participants were most likely to defect against their partner after  anger induction and least likely to defect after sympathy induction,  with the neutral condition eliciting intermediate defection rates. This  pattern was found to be strongest in participants exhibiting low  cognitive control (as measured by a Go\/no-Go task). The findings  indicate that emotions felt toward another individual alter how one  chooses to interact with them, and that this influence depends both on  the specific emotion induced and the cognitive control of the  individual.","1366":"Studied  the effects of age and Ss' orientations on the kind of information  children request concerning their partners in a trading game. A total of  52 6th- and 8th-grade students (male and female) made 20 trades, each  of which consisted of sending 1 of 4 alternative \"goods\" to their  partner and receiving 1 of 4 alternative goods from their (programmed)  partner in return. Each of the goods was of high or low value (in  imaginary dollars) to the player who received them and of high or low  cost to the player who sent them. Ss were told the value to themselves  of the goods they received and the cost to themselves of the goods they  sent. They were not told the values and costs of the other player but  could \"buy\" this information from the E. Ss tended to ask for more  information concerning the value to the other of what they sent than  concerning the cost to the other of what they received. Also, 8th  graders asked for more information concerning others' costs than 6th  graders. The tendency to ask for more value than cost information was  most marked among (a) those Ss who sent least high-value goods to their  partner and (b) those Ss who, on the basis of a pretest, appeared to be  individualistically rather than competitively oriented. Differences in  the amount of cost information requested may reflect differences in Ss'  interest in making valid attributions concerning their partners'  intentions.

We report three studies that examined the Prisoner's Dilemma  Game (PDG) as a paradigm for evaluation of non-clinical paranoia. The  PDG captures three key qualities that are at the heart of paranoia\u2014it is  interpersonal, it concerns threat, and it concerns the perception of  others' intentions towards the self. Study 1 (n=175) found that state paranoia was positively associated with selection of the competitive PDG choice. Study 2 (n=111)  found that this association was significant only when participants  believed they were playing the PDG against another person, and not when  playing against a computer. This finding underscores the interpersonal  nature of paranoia and the concomitant necessity of studying paranoia in  interpersonal context. In Study 3 (n=152), we assessed both  trait and state paranoia, and differentiated between distrust- and  greed-based competition. Both trait and state paranoia were positively  associated with distrust-based competition (but not with greed-based  competition). Crucially, we found that the association between trait  paranoia and distrust-based competition was fully mediated by state  paranoia. The PDG is a promising paradigm for the study of non-clinical  paranoia.

A second experiment found that independent  evaluations of the labels led to perceptions that were similar to  individuals' choices in the first experiment.

Most crucially, a mediational analysis and a manipulation of the  order in which these dependent variables were measured established that  the prime-to-behavior link can be strengthened by an intervening task  calling for explicit construal of the situation. The interplay of  situational construal and implicit primes in producing deliberative  behavior is discussed.","1370":"The  relationship between cooperative play and specific matrix entry values  was examined for three non-zero-sum games.

The amount of absolute gain available  through a competitive choice was the same in games I and II, but greater  in game III. Thus, competition offered the least amount of differential  gain for game I, equal differential gain for games II and III, equal  absolute gain for games I and II, and greatest absolute gain for game  III. Ss were found to be highly cooperative in game I, somewhat less  cooperative in game II, and markedly less cooperative in game III.

Because exchange structures were studied only as iterated games,  whether one-shot structures differ was not known. Nor have exchange  theories previously considered whether events in structures would be  different if studied as one-shot games. This paper offers new theory to  predict one-shot exchange structures and one-shot experiments to test  that theory. As predicted, the experiments found that processes and  outcomes of one-shot exchange structures are quite different from those  of iterated exchange structures. For example, certain relations that are  strategically used as threats in iterated exchange structures occur  very rarely in one-shot structures. It follows that power differences in  one-shot structures regress from those observed for repeated  structures.","1372":"When  people are confronted with social dilemmas, their decision-making  strategies tend to be associated with individual social preferences;  prosocials have an intrinsic willingness to cooperate, while proselfs  need extrinsic motivators signaling personal gain. In this study, the  biological roots for the proselfs\/prosocials concept are explored by  investigating the neural correlates of cooperative versus defect  decisions when participants engage in a series of one-shot, anonymous  prisoner\u2019s dilemma situations. Our data are in line with previous  studies showing that prosocials activate several social cognition  regions of the brain more than proselfs (here: medial prefrontal cortex,  temporo\u2013parietal junction, and precuneus BA 7 (Brodmann area 7), and  that dispositional trust positively affects prosocials\u2019 decisions to  cooperate. At the neural level, however, dispositional trust appears to  exert a greater marginal effect on brain activity of proselfs in three  social cognition regions, which does not translate into an increase in  cooperation. An event-related analysis shows that cooperating prosocials  show significantly more activation in the precuneus (BA 7) than  proselfs. Based on previous research, we interpret this result to be  consistent with prosocials\u2019 enhanced tendency to infer the intentions of  others in social dilemma games, and the importance of establishing norm  congruence when they decide to cooperate.","1373":" This  study uses fMRI to investigate the cognitive demands of decision-making  in two types of cooperation games: a prisoner's dilemma (PD) eliciting a  temptation to free-ride, leading to a dominant, self-interested  response, and a stag hunt (SH) that has no dominant response but offers  pay-off incentives that make mutual cooperation collectively beneficial  but risky. Consequently, the PD poses greater conflict between self- and  collective interest, greater demands for computational reasoning to  derive the optimal solution, and greater demands for mentalizing to  infer the intentions of others. Consistent with these differences  between the two games, the results indicate that the PD is associated  with increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, prefrontal  cortex, parietal lobe, and temporoparietal junction. With less conflict,  the demands for computation and mentalizing are reduced in the SH, and  cooperation levels increase dramatically.

Often, impure  public goods have a charitable or ethical dimension, giving ethically  motivated consumers a convenient option to contribute to public goods  through the marketplace (in addition to direct donations). Impure public  goods could potentially promote ethical giving or alternatively hinder  charitable behaviour. We implement an economics experiment with a  between-subject design to test the behavioural relevance of impure  public goods with only a token (i.e. small) contribution to a public  good. Contributions to the public good are negatively affected by the  presence of impure public goods with token contributions. We explore one  mechanism to offset this negative impact by making the token impure  public good mandatory. We observe higher average contributions and  several positive impacts on charitable behaviour, which supports the  claim that this mechanism can potentially offset the negative impact of  impure public goods.","1379":"Green  goods such as recycled paper stationary or carbon-neutral flights  provide increasingly popular examples of impure public goods. Motivated  by theoretical treatments of green goods as a bundle of private and  public characteristics in proportions fixed by the provider, we design  an experiment with two linked treatments to test how the presence of  impure public goods affects behaviour towards public good causes. We set  parameters, such that from a standard economic perspective the presence  of the impure public good is behaviourally irrelevant. In a treatment  where the impure public good provides only small contributions to the  public good, we observe that on aggregate pro-social behaviour is lower  in the presence of the impure public good. On the contrary, in the  treatment where the impure public good is more generous towards the  public good component at the expense of private earnings, individuals  are unaffected in their behaviour. We observe that impure public goods,  that are theoretically irrelevant and are mostly self-interested, may  hinder pro-social behaviour and look for explanations in social  psychology, such as the phenomenon of thoughtful anchoring, motivated  reasoning and reluctant altruism. The results from this experiment  question the role of green goods in enhancing environmentally friendly  behaviours.","1380":"We  report the results of a trust survey and public goods experiment  conducted with high school students in rural Thailand and Cambodia that  together help clarify the dynamics at work in sustaining economic  cooperation within these two third-world communities.

In a laboratory  experiment we find that the answer is affirmative if the institution is  imposed on the group but negative if development of the institution is  left to the group to vote on. In the experiment, participants were  divided into groups of either cooperative types or non-cooperative types  depending on their behavior in a public goods game. In these  homogeneous groups they repeatedly played a public goods game regulated  by an institution that incorporated several of the key properties  identified by Ostrom: operational rules, monitoring, rewards,  punishments, and (in one condition) change of rules. When change of  rules was not possible and punishments were set to be high, groups of  both types generally abided by operational rules demanding high  contributions to the common good, and thereby achieved high levels of  payoffs. Under less severe rules, both types of groups did worse but  non-cooperative types did worst. Thus, non-cooperative groups profited  the most from being governed by an institution demanding high  contributions and employing high punishments. Nevertheless, in a  condition where change of rules through voting was made possible,  development of the institution in this direction was more often voted  down in groups of non-cooperative types.

The prevailing view is that individuals use  punishment to retaliate against transgressions of moral standards such  as fairness or equity. However, there is much debate regarding the  psychological underpinnings of costly punishment. Some authors suggest  that costly punishment must be a product of humans' capacity for  reasoning, self-control and long-term planning, whereas others argue  that it is the result of an impulsive, present-oriented emotional drive.  Here, we explore the inter-temporal preferences of punishers in a  multilateral cooperation game and show that both interpretations might  be right, as we can identify two different types of punishment:  punishment of free-riders by cooperators, which is predicted by patience  (future orientation); and free-riders' punishment of other free-riders,  which is predicted by impatience (present orientation). Therefore, the  picture is more complex as punishment by free-riders probably comes not  from a reaction against a moral transgression, but instead from a  competitive, spiteful drive. Thus, punishment grounded on morals may be  related to lasting or delayed psychological incentives, whereas  punishment triggered by competitive desires may be linked to short-run  aspirations. These results indicate that the individual's time horizon  is relevant for the type of social behaviour she opts for.

Moreover, we  address three major methodological limitations of previous research in  this area: a lack of an unconstrained control condition; non-compliance  with time manipulations leading to high rates of exclusions and thus a  selection bias; and non-comprehension of the structure of the game. Even  after eliminating participant selection bias and non-comprehension, we  find that deliberation decreases cooperation: even in competitive  contexts towards out-groups and even in a losses frame, though the  differences in cooperation between groups was consistent across  conditions.

Furthermore, participants receiving placebo contributed more to the  within-group pool when they were cognitively taxed rather than not;  those receiving oxytocin contributed to the within-group pool regardless  of cognitive taxation. Neither taxation nor treatment influenced  contributions to the between-group pool, and no significant sex  differences were observed. It follows that in intergroup settings (i)  oxytocin increases in-group bounded cooperation, (ii) oxytocin neither  reduces nor increases out-group directed spite, and (iii)  oxytocin-induced in-group cooperation is independent of cognitive  taxation and, therefore, likely to be intuitive rather than consciously  deliberated.","1406":"Research  on video games has yielded consistent findings that violent video games  increase aggression and decrease prosocial behavior.

Here we  present results from a series of experiments which show that, as  predicted by the sexual selection hypothesis, people preferentially  direct cooperative behavior towards more attractive members of the  opposite sex. Furthermore, cooperative behavior increases the perceived  attractiveness of the cooperator. Economically costly behaviors can  therefore bring benefits through mate choice and sexual selection should  be regarded as an evolutionary mechanism capable of promoting  cooperation.","1415":"Given  that private rewards have mixed effectiveness in the realm of prosocial  behaviours (B\u00e9nabou and Tirole, 2006), we explore whether a \u2018public\u2019  reward (denominated in additional units of public good provision)  successfully encourages prosocial behaviour in the form of increased  donations to a project aimed at improving atmospheric air quality.

We  studied the effects of discounting and strategic reciprocity on  cooperation in captive blue jays. Our results demonstrate an interaction  between discounting and reciprocity. Blue jays show high stable levels  of cooperation in treatments with reduced discounting when their  opponent reciprocates, but their levels of cooperation decline in all  other treatment combinations.

Here we ask how Neuroticism influences the neural  response to positive and negative social interactions and how  Neuroticism modulates the effect of intranasal oxytocin (OT) and  vasopressin (AVP) on the neural response to social interactions. In a  double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 153 male participants were  randomized to receive 24\u00a0IU intranasal OT, 20 IU AVP or placebo.  Afterwards, they were imaged with fMRI while playing an iterated  Prisoner's Dilemma Game. On a different day, subjects completed the NEO  personality inventory to measure Neuroticism. Neuroticism was positively  correlated with the neural response to negative social interactions in  the anterior cingulate cortex\/medial prefrontal cortex and with the  neural response to positive social interactions in the insula,  indicating that Neuroticism modulates neuropsychological processing of  both negative and positive social interactions. Neuroticism did not  modulate the effect of intranasal OT treatment on the neural response to  either positive or negative social interactions. On the other hand, AVP  treatment significantly interacted with Neuroticism to modulate the  BOLD response to both positive and negative social interactions.  Specifically, AVP increased anterior cingulate cortex\/medial prefrontal  cortex and lateral temporal lobe responses to negative social  interactions to a greater extent in participants scoring high rather  than low on Neuroticism. AVP also increased the insula response to  positive social interactions to a greater extent in participants scoring  high rather than low on Neuroticism. These results imply that AVP may  increase emotion regulation in response to negative social interactions  and the salience of positive social interactions to a greater extent in  individuals high compared to low in Neuroticism. The current findings  urge caution against uniform clinical application of nonapeptides and  suggest that their efficacy may vary as a function of personality.","1423":"Social  value orientations (SVOs) are economic preferences for the distribution  of resources \u2013 prosocial individuals are more cooperative and  egalitarian than are proselfs.

More importantly, we predicted that Honesty\u2013Humility would explain  differences between these games in which the power of the recipient to  retaliate is varied. Both conjectures were corroborated in a  semi-experimental study with N\u00a0=\u00a0134  participants: individuals low in Honesty\u2013Humility made more selfish  decisions and only shifted towards a more fair allocation whenever the  other was empowered to punish defection.

Relatively little attention, however, has been  given to the effects of context in negatively-framed VCM games even  though this setting is relevant to a wide array of real world  challenges, such as common pool resource use and pollution  externalities. This study uses a carefully-controlled laboratory  experiment to investigate the degree to which the context in which  decisions are made influences decision making in a negatively-framed VCM  laboratory experiment. The context treatments that we evaluate vary  communication, voting, and the status quo of the initial endowment.  Results indicate that providing groups the opportunity to communicate  and vote significantly reduces choices that impose external costs.  Importantly, the pro-social effects of communication and voting are  strongest when the status quo endowment is the private account, which  generates costs on other participants. This result suggests that the  effect of the status quo endowment is a function of whether the social  dilemma is framed positively or negatively when communication between  participants is allowed.","1445":"The  effects of group size and cooperativeness of others upon an  individual's propensity to cooperate is studied using the Take-Some  format of the Prisoner's Dilemma game.

However, it is  debated whether these results of human cooperative behavior extend  beyond such settings and whether they are valid in other contexts.  Critical issues include the absence of context, the very short period of  play and possible observer effects.

This  article focuses on the robustness of previous findings about cooperative  strategies and whether different types of cooperative behavior extend  beyond the laboratory setting. Thus, the data presented provides  external validity to existing laboratory experiments. The results  suggest some important qualifications to previous work, since less high  cooperators and a differing proportion of conditional cooperation are  found. However, this data confirms the reported proportion of free  riders at about 25% of the population. Cooperative strategies appear to  be stable over time, individually fixed and rather independent of  environmental parameters.","1449":"Highlights\u2022We model climate change as a dynamic threshold public good game.\u2022We experimentally examine the effect of milestones prior the final target.\u2022A probabilistic total loss occurs if targets (milestones or final) are missed.\u2022Milestones only increase contributions when free-riding \u201cdisincentives\u201d are low.\u2022Milestones on its own do not guarantee that the final target is met.AbstractWe  analyze the effect of \u201cmilestones\u201d on reaching a long-term target,  which if missed implies dramatic payoff risks. In our experiment, a  cumulative threshold public goods game, milestones are captured by  intermediate contribution targets on the way to the final target.  Missing the final target leads to a probabilistic total loss for all  players, and missing intermediate targets may lead to the same  consequences even earlier. The additional intermediate targets feature  environmental protection as a process rather than a contest for reaching  a final target. The regulating agency is Nature, although political  agencies might implement a similar regulation. We test milestone effects  by varying the size of milestones in addition to changing the marginal  productivity of individual contributions and the payoff risk. Although  we observe some milestone effects, additional regulation by milestones  on its own does not guarantee that targets are reached.","1450":"  Abstract  A multi\u2010stage social dilemma was used to explore the notion  that focusing on part rather than all of a complex problem would affect  self\u2010efficacy and action.

This  phenomenon is captured by prisoner's dilemma games, in which cooperation  rates appear to be determined by the distinctive structure of economic  incentives (e.g., $3 for mutual cooperation vs. $5 for unilateral  defection). Rather than comparing economic values of cooperating versus not ($3 vs. $5), we tested the hypothesis that players simply compare numeric values  (3 vs. 5), such that subjective numbers (mental magnitudes) are  logarithmically scaled. Supporting our hypothesis, increasing only  numeric values of rewards (from $3 to 300\u00a2) increased cooperation (Study 1), whereas increasing economic values increased cooperation only when there were also numeric increases (Study 2).  Thus, changing rewards from 3\u00a2 to 300\u00a2 increased cooperation rates, but  an economically identical change from 3\u00a2 to $3 elicited no gains.  Finally, logarithmically scaled reward values predicted 97% of variation  in cooperation, whereas the face value of economic rewards predicted  none. We conclude that representations of numeric value constrain how  economic rewards affect cooperation.","1460":"Relatedness  is a cornerstone of the evolution of social behavior.

This paper examines  the relative importance of these two mechanisms under two income  distributions in team cooperation. In a repeated public good experiment,  we use different combinations of homogeneous\/heterogeneous endowments,  strong\/weak identity, and absence\/presence of peer punishment. We find  that without punishment, a strong identity can raise cooperation in  homogenous and heterogeneous teams, but that the effect depends on the  strength of the identity. When punishment is introduced, the impact of  punishment depends on the strength of the identity-building activity and  the effectiveness of punishment. Furthermore, we find no evidence of  stronger cooperation or punishment in teams with strong identity. These  findings provide important implications for management policy makers in  organizations: ex ante income heterogeneity should be implemented in  teams with caution, and the decision of whether identity or punishment  is a more effective norm enforcement mechanism in teams is rather  sensitive to their interaction and relative strengths.","1475":"Mechanisms  to overcome social dilemmas provide incentives to maximize efficiency.

Results for the 3 independent variables show  that: (a) increasing the difficulty of the bargaining problem, increased  trial time and reduced frequency of agreement; (b) in a comparison of  money and points incentives, the former had positive effects on the  negotiation, both in terms of preinteraction attitudes and in terms of  subsequent interaction and negotiation outcomes; and (c) the creation in  1 condition of an unequal dependence of the 2 parties upon agreement  did not have the anticipated disruptive effect upon the interaction.  Analysis of differences among the sets of data from the 8 research sites  suggests that the negotiation situation was defined in 2 ways. This was  reflected in different meanings given to the dimension of cooperation  vs. competition in the interaction. At some sites, this dimension was  given an evaluative meaning good vs. bad; at other sites, it was given a  dynamism meaning weak and passive vs. strong and active. These 2  meanings had different implications for the process and outcomes of the  negotiation and for the relation between the Ss' pregame attitudes and  their subsequent behavior. (32 ref.)

In the  second part of the experiment, participants appropriate the common  resource after one of three possible regulations is elected and  implemented. There is less overharvesting after the rules are  implemented, but there is a significant amount of rule breaking. The  surprising finding is that Colombian villagers break the rules of the  games more often than other groups, and even more so when they have more  trust in members of the community.

To test this, we  focus on a ubiquitous real-life source of conditional behaviour: the expected relational value  of social partners, both in terms of their quality and the likely  quantity of future interactions with them. We allow for conversational  interaction among participants prior to their playing an unannounced,  one-shot prisoner's dilemma game, which fosters naturalistic  interpersonal evaluation and conditional behaviour, while controlling  punishment and reputation effects. Individuals scoring higher on factor 1  (callous affect, interpersonal manipulation) of the  Levenson self-report psychopathy scale defected conditionally on two  kinds of low-value partners: those who interrupted them more during the  conversation, and those with whom they failed to discover cues to future  interaction. Both interaction effects support the hypothesis that  subclinical primary psychopathy potentiates defection on those with low  expected relational value. These data clarify the function and form of  psychopathic traits, while highlighting adaptive variation in human  social strategies.","1491":"To  account for the widespread human tendency to cooperate in one-shot  social dilemmas, some theorists have proposed that cooperators can be  reliably detected based on ethological displays that are difficult to  fake.

To address this problem, we propose and apply a new approach for the  unbiased measurement of cooperativeness in social dilemma games.  Specifically, we employ an extension of the randomized\u2010response  technique (RRT). The RRT protects the privacy of respondents by adding  random noise to their responses. It thus encourages more honest  responding and thereby provides less biased estimates of sensitive  attributes. In a large\u2010scale study with 2043 respondents we maximized  anonymity in a one\u2010shot prisoner's dilemma game through use of the RRT.  Comparing the prevalence rates for cooperation obtained via the RRT with  those from direct self\u2010report showed that traditional direct  questioning formats overestimate cooperation rates, with a relative bias  of 18%. This finding suggests that to a considerable extent,  self\u2010reported cooperation is due to socially desirable responding,  rather than actual cooperativeness. However, our results also  demonstrate that cooperation remains substantial even under conditions  of maximized anonymity. Copyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

These  predictions are evaluated in a laboratory experiment with a range of  group sizes. Observed volunteer rates are lower with larger groups, as  predicted, but the incidence of no-volunteer outcomes declines with  group size, in contrast to theory. This reduction in no-volunteer  outcomes for large groups can be explained by a one-parameter  generalization of the Nash equilibrium that adds quantal response  \u201cnoise\u201d due to unobserved random effects. Significant individual  heterogeneity in observed volunteer rates motivates the estimation of a  heterogeneous equilibrium model with a distribution of propensities for  volunteering.","1497":"Volunteer's  dilemmas that evolve over time are presented and modeled as  noncooperative n-person games in extensive form with symmetric players,  discrete time, finite horizon, and complete information.

The authors construct  symmetric and asymmetric subgame perfect equilibria to the game. An  experimental study shows that financially motivated subjects who are  rewarded contingent on their performance volunteer more readily when the  cost of volunteering is relatively low; that they largely fail to  coordinate on any of the asymmetric equilibria in which only a single  subject volunteers immediately; that they volunteer, on average, earlier  than predicted; and that they vary considerably from one another in  their inclination to free ride.","1498":" Abstract We systematically investigate prisoner\u2019s dilemma games and dictator  games with valence framing.

Subjects have to pay a fee over and above punishment  costs if they wish to condition punishments on previous play, which is  equivalent to a binary choice between the acquisition of perfect  information on the target subject\u2019s behavior and no information at all.  When monitoring is costly both second and third party punishment is  weaker and less discriminate and hence generates weaker incentives for  cooperation than when monitoring is free. There are subtle differences  between second and third parties: The presence of monitoring costs leads  subjects to withhold sanctioning more often as second parties than as  third parties, and to punish indiscriminately more often as third  parties than as second parties.

The results of this study suggest that behavioral  reactions to conditional contributions are a function of the motivation  ascribed to conditional contributors, which in turn appears to be a  function of the interest conditional contributors have in providing the  public good. In more general terms, the results suggest that group  members reciprocate the motivation they ascribe to the conditional  contributor.","1517":"<jats:sec id=\"S0033291715002834_sec_a1\"><jats:title>Background<\/jats:title><jats:p>Depression is a disabling disorder that significantly impacts on the interpersonal functioning of individuals.

Giving rewards to contributors transforms the game but  gives rise to a second-order dilemma. By allowing for coevolution of  strategies and network structure, the evolutionary dynamics operate on  both structure and strategy. Players learn with whom to interact and how  to act and can overcome the second-order dilemma. More specifically,  the network represents social distance which changes as players  interact. Through the change in social distance, players learn with whom  to interact, which we model using reinforcement dynamics. We find that,  for certain parameter constellations, a social institution, prescribing  prosocial behavior and thus solving the second-order dilemma, can  emerge from a population of selfish players. Due to the dynamic  structure of the network, the institution has an endogenous punishment  mechanism ensuring that defectors will be excluded from the benefits of  the institution and the public good will be supplied efficiently.","1525":"Axelrod  (The evolution of cooperation, 1984) and others explain how cooperation  can emerge in repeated 2-person prisoner\u2019s dilemmas. But in public good  games with anonymous contributions, we expect a breakdown of  cooperation because direct reciprocity fails. However, if agents are  situated in a social network determining which agents interact, and if  they can influence the network, then cooperation can be a viable  strategy. Social networks are modelled as graphs. Agents play public  good games with their neighbours. After each game, they can terminate  connections to others, and new connections are created. Cooperative  agents do well because they manage to cluster with cooperators and avoid  defectors. Computer simulations demonstrate that group formation and  exclusion are powerful mechanisms to promote cooperation in dilemma  situations. This explains why social dilemmas can often be solved if  agents can choose with whom they interact.","1526":"nan","1527":"Highlights\u2022Experimental test of reputation systems in a prisoner's dilemma with varying partners.\u2022Evaluations are endogenous and noisy because they are subjective judgments.\u2022Information about the partner's evaluation is not sufficient to raise contributions.\u2022Cooperation depends also on second-order beliefs.\u2022Second-order beliefs depend on information about the own evaluation.AbstractWe  investigate a repeated public good game with group size two and  stranger matching. Contributions are public information and each  participant evaluates her partner's contribution.

Evaluations are subjective judgments, hence our  reputation system allows for some degree of noise. There are two  information treatments: Each participant receives information either  about her partner's evaluation, or about her own and her partner's  evaluation.

A chi-square  analysis revealed significant differences in the attribution of sex to  the anonymous confederate between the competitive and the combined  cooperative and tit-for-tat groups. In the competitive condition,  subjects were more prone to think that the anonymous confederate was  male than were subjects in the cooperative and tit-for-tat condition.

I identify three normative foundations of Eastern Orthodox  monasticism with strong economic implications: 1. solidarity, 2.  obedience, and 3. universal discipline. I propose a public goods game  with a three-tier hierarchy, where these norms are modeled as  treatments. Obedience and universal discipline facilitate the provision  of threshold public goods in equilibrium, whereas solidarity does not.  Empirical evidence is drawn from public goods experiments run with  regional bureaucrats in Tomsk and Novosibirsk, Russia. The introduction  of the same three norms as experimental treatments produces different  results. I find that only universal discipline leads to the provision of  threshold public goods, whereas solidarity and obedience do not. Unlike  in Protestant societies, in Eastern Orthodox societies free-riding  occurs at lower than at higher hierarchical levels. Successful economic  reforms in Eastern Orthodox countries start with the restructuring of  the middle- and lower-ranked public sector. Authoritarian persistence is  defined by the commitment of the dictator to overprovide public goods.","1533":"Human  cooperation is enigmatic, as organisms are expected, by evolutionary  and economic theory, to act principally in their own interests. However,  cooperation requires individuals to sacrifice resources for each  other\u2019s benefit. We conducted a series of novel experiments in a  foraging society where social institutions make the study of social  image and punishment particularly salient. Participants played simple  cooperation games where they could punish non-cooperators, promote a  positive social image or do so in combination with one another. We show  that although all these mechanisms raise cooperation above baseline  levels, only when social image alone is at stake do average economic  gains rise significantly above baseline. Punishment, either alone or  combined with social image building, yields lower gains. Individuals\u2019  desire to establish a positive social image thus emerges as a more  decisive factor than punishment in promoting human cooperation.","1534":"Can  the threat of being shamed or the prospect of being honoured lead to  greater cooperation? We test this hypothesis with anonymous six-player  public goods experiments, an experimental paradigm used to investigate  problems related to overusing common resources. We instructed the  players that the two individuals who were least generous after 10 rounds  would be exposed to the group. As the natural antithesis, we also test  the effects of honour by revealing the identities of the two players who  were most generous. The non-monetary, reputational effects induced by  shame and honour each led to approximately 50 per cent higher donations  to the public good when compared with the control, demonstrating that  both shame and honour can drive cooperation and can help alleviate the  tragedy of the commons.","1535":"We  experimentally investigate the effect of endogenous matching within a  segmented population on peoples\u2019 willingness to cooperate as well as  their attitudes towards cooperative norms. In the experiment  participants can repeatedly choose between two groups, where in one of  them a (local) punishment institution fosters cooperation. The degree of  population viscosity (i.e. the extent to which matching is biased  towards within-group interactions) is varied across treatments. We find  that both, the share of participants that choose into the group with the  punishment institution and the share of participants that cooperate,  increase monotonically with the degree of population viscosity.  Furthermore \u2013 with higher population viscosity \u2013 significantly more  subjects claim to support a punishment institution in a  post-experimental questionnaire.Research Highlights\u25ba  In a segmented population people voluntarily participate in a local  punishment institution if interaction with outsiders is unlikely enough.  \u25ba Self selection into institutions can sustain cooperation if  population viscosity is high enough. \u25ba A punishment institution that  successfully implements cooperative behavior shifts the agents\u2019  attitudes towards norm enforcement.","1536":"Based  on a simple theoretical framework, we show that when individuals  exhibit positional, prosocial or conformist preferences which are  endogenous, the end outcomes in terms of private provision of public  goods can differ significantly from traditional neo-classical  predictions. Indeed, when a given individual selects a specific subset  of preferences according to what others do, he\/she will contribute  positively to the public good provision. We provide anecdotal evidence  to support our theoretical analysis by using data from an Internet  survey on a sample of French individuals. Analyses of individual  responses confirm our theoretical arguments. For instance, we show that  relative concerns matter, that is, for several environmental goods,  people might prefer polluting more in absolute terms but less than  others in society. Moreover, we also test whether people exhibit a  social desirability bias and show that they attribute more (less)  positional (prosocial) concerns to others in society.Highlights\u25ba  Positional, prosocial and conformist preferences matter and may explain  voluntary contribution to public goods. These preferences do not lead  to identical contribution levels and thus do not have identical impacts  on social welfare. \u25ba For several environmental goods, people might  prefer polluting more in absolute terms but less than others in society.  \u25ba People attribute more (less) positional (prosocial) concerns to  others in society.","1537":" Abstract We investigate the dynamics of cooperation in public good games  when contributions to the public good are immediately redistributed  across contributors (intra-temporal transfers) and when contributions to  the public good by the current group are transferred over time to a  future group (inter-temporal transfers). We show that people are more  cooperative in inter-temporal contexts than in intra-temporal contexts.  We also find that subjects invest more on average in public goods when  they know in advance their inheritance from the past.  ","1538":"The  prevalence of cooperation among humans is puzzling because cooperators  can be exploited by free riders. Peer punishment has been suggested as a  solution to this puzzle, but cumulating evidence questions its  robustness in sustaining cooperation. Amongst others, punishment fails  when it is not powerful enough, or when it elicits counter-punishment.  Existing research, however, has ignored that the distribution of  punishment power can be the result of social interactions. We introduce a  novel experiment in which individuals can transfer punishment power to  others. We find that while decentralised peer punishment fails to  overcome free riding, the voluntary transfer of punishment power enables  groups to sustain cooperation. This is achieved by non-punishing  cooperators empowering those who are willing to punish in the interest  of the group. Our results show how voluntary power centralisation can  efficiently sustain cooperation, which could explain why hierarchical  power structures are widespread among animals and humans.","1539":"Punishment  may deter antisocial behavior. Yet to punish is costly, and the costs  often do not offset the gains that are due to elevated levels of  cooperation. However, the effectiveness of punishment depends not only  on how costly it is, but also on the circumstances defining the social  dilemma. Using the snowdrift game as the basis, we have conducted a  series of economic experiments to determine whether severe punishment is  more effective than mild punishment. We have observed that severe  punishment is not necessarily more effective, even if the cost of  punishment is identical in both cases. The benefits of severe punishment  become evident only under extremely adverse conditions, when to  cooperate is highly improbable in the absence of sanctions. If  cooperation is likely, mild punishment is not less effective and leads  to higher average payoffs, and is thus the much preferred alternative.  Presented results suggest that the positive effects of punishment stem  not only from imposed fines, but may also have a psychological  background. Small fines can do wonders in motivating us to chose  cooperation over defection, but without the paralyzing effect that may  be brought about by large fines. The later should be utilized only when  absolutely necessary. ","1540":"The  relative effectiveness of pacifistic and retaliatory strategies in  eliciting cooperating in a mixed-motive game is unclear due to  confounded manipulations of these strategies and inadequate experimental  designs in earlier research.

A multivariate analysis of repeated measures in experiment 1  revealed an effect of strategies and an interaction of strategies by  trial blocks. The low retaliatory strategy elicited the most cooperative  behavior, the high retaliatory next, and the nonretaliatory least,  these differences increasing over trials.","1541":"We  provide an experimental investigation of the fair rule preference and  its effect on anonymous cooperation, intending to test the hypothesis  that people who exhibit high degrees of rule inequality  aversion\u2014consider \u201cequality and mutual obligation under the social  contract\u201d as justified, are disgusted with free-rider behavior in the  public goods game and are more likely to be conditional cooperators and  make conditional contributions. Based on experimental work related to  rule-preferences Chla\u00df and Moffatt (Giving in dictator games:  experimenter demand effect or preference over the rules of the game?  (No. 2012, 044). Jena Economic Research Papers, 2012) and the public goods game Fischbacher et al.

We investigated the relationship between rule preferences  and cooperative preferences (conditional reciprocal preference) and  tried to explain the adjustments people made when making repeated  contributions of public goods (conditional cooperation behavior) from a  rule preference perspective. The results show that: (1) Heterogeneous  rule-inequality-aversion preferences are found in lab; (2) The stronger  the rule-inequality-aversion preference is, the higher the probability  is for the individual to become a conditional cooperator in public goods  experiment; (3) Individuals who have stronger rule-inequality-aversion  are more sensitive to the contributions that are deviated from the norm.  Compared to the theory of conditional cooperation types,  rule-inequality-aversion preference has a better explanation power when  it comes to the behavior adjustment in repeated public goods  contribution.","1542":"In this paper, we show that Case-based decision theory, proposed by Gilboa and Schmeidler (Q J Econ 110(3):605\u2013639, 1995),  can explain the aggregate dynamics of cooperation in the repeated  Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, as observed in the experiments performed by Camera  and Casari (Am Econ Rev 99:979\u20131005, 2009).  Moreover, we find CBDT provides a better fit to the dynamics of  cooperation than does the existing Probit model, which is the first time  such a result has been found. We also find that humans aspire to a  payoff above the mutual defection outcome but below the mutual  cooperation outcome, which suggests they hope, but are not confident,  that cooperation can be achieved. Finally, our best-fitting parameters  suggest that circumstances with more details are easier to recall. We  make a prediction for future experiments: if the repeated PD were run  for more periods, then we would be begin to see an increase in  cooperation, most dramatically in the second treatment, where history is  observed but identities are not. This is the first application of  Case-based decision theory to a strategic context and the first  empirical test of CBDT in such a context. It is also the first  application of bootstrapped standard errors to an agent-based model.","1543":"We  examined the mutability of naturally occurring mutual cooperation and  mutual defection. Forty-five pairs of subjects participated in an  extended iterated prisoner's dilemma (median duration 1807 trials) using  a monetary payoff matrix. When stable cooperation or defection emerged,  false feedback was provided indicating to each subject that his partner  was choosing contrary to previously stable play. This was followed by  recovery trials in which false feedback indicated to each subject that  his partner had resumed making the previously stable choice.While  stable cooperation occurred more frequently than stable defection, it  was considerably more vulnerable to the false feedback manipulation.  This was true both in terms of the extent to which choice changed in  response to false feedback (p=0.006) and in terms of the extent to which the disruption persisted (p&lt;0.001).  While the effect of four false feedback cooperations was undone by a  single recovery false feedback defection, the effect of even a single  false feedback defection was still apparent after seven false feedback  recovery cooperations. These results are discussed in relation to the  analogy between interpersonal bargaining and intertemporal bargaining  within individuals.","1544":"Highlights\u2022We find that personality types of partners influence cooperation in social dilemmas.\u2022Cooperative actions are conditioned on the traits of partners.\u2022Reciprocal expectations are formed of partners with certain traits.\u2022Agreeable and Openness traits are viewed as cooperative traits in partners.AbstractWe  investigate whether cooperative behavior in social dilemmas is  conditional on information about a partner's personality traits.

However, a failure to yield on the part of both  groups leads to an outcome (e.g., war, strike) that is disastrous to all  the players. The authors report an experiment in which an intergroup  chicken game with two players on each team was compared to a two-person  chicken game and a (single-group) four-person chicken game.

This study  investigates whether minimal information about an interaction partner's  membership in a trivial social group affects the allocations of adults  and children in dictator game, reciprocity in a sequential prisoner's  dilemma, and altruistic punishment in a third-party punishment game. In  all, 155 adults and 157 students from second and sixth grade played  these three economic games in either an ingroup, outgroup, or neutral  condition. Adults and sixth-grade children allocated more to ingroup  than to outgroup receivers in the dictator game, and adults punished  ingroup non-cooperators more in the third-party punishment game than  outgroup non-cooperators. When additional information about the other  player's past behavior was presented, adults reciprocated equally with  ingroup, outgroup, and neutral players, whereas children from sixth  grade reciprocated more with ingroup and neutral than with outgroup  players. Overall, the results of this study support the importance of  group membership and reciprocity for adults' and older elementary school  children's altruistic behavior.

On each trial A had to choose the intensity of  shock to be delivered to himself and to B. B then was given a chance to  retaliate, although his choices were actually overridden by the  experimenter. A 10 sec tone (CS) preceded delivery of shock to each S . There were no differences between Groups P and NP in the intensity of shock chosen for themselves and for the other (B) S s.  Compared with Group NP, Group P gave small unconditioned skin  conductance (SC) responses to shock directly received and to shocks  delivered to the other S . There were no differences between  groups in the unconditioned HR response to either direct shock  (acceleration) or to shocks delivered to the other S  (slight  deceleration).

Our findings demonstrate how individuals over time adjust their behavior to local conditions. We do not find significant adjustment to global group average, suggesting that the local group creates a salient reference group for social comparisons in multilevel public goods provision.

Participants receive either common or private signals about the point of  no return, and experience either high or low reductions in payoffs if  insufficient contributions are made. Our data reveal that, as expected,  contributions are higher if the cost of not reaching the threshold is  high than if it is low. High signal values discourage contributions and  endanger the likelihood of success when signals are common, but not when  signals are private.

In the game, both  players have a dominating strategy choice but the \u201cnatural\u201d outcome of  the game, defined as the intersection of dominating strategy choices,  gives one player his largest payoff and the other player his next to  smallest. However, the \u201cdissatis-fied\u201d player (the one who does not  receive his largest payoff at the natural outcome) can, by switching his  strategy choice, reduce the other's payoffs but only at a cost to  himself.

One factor that may contribute to individual  differences in cooperation is a key gene within the oxytocin (OT)  system, the OT reception gene (OXTR). In this article, we aim to bridge the gap between the OXTR gene and cooperation by using an endophenotype approach. We present evidence that the association between the OXTR gene and cooperation may in part be due to how the OXTR  gene affects brain systems involved in emotion recognition,  empathy\/theory of mind, social communication and social reward seeking.  There is evidence that the OXTR gene is associated with the  functional anatomy of the amygdala, visual cortex (VC), anterior  cingulate and superior temporal gyrus (STG). However, it is currently  unknown how the OXTR gene may be linked to the functional anatomy  of other relevant brain regions that include the fusiform gyrus (FG),  superior temporal sulcus (STS), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC),  temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc).

In our  evolutionary model, computational agents populate a large complex  network, engage into multiplayer Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma-like interactions,  and reproduce sexually. Agents carry discernible phenotypic traits  subject to mutation, memorize their own experiences, and employ  different strategies when interacting with different types of  co-players. Choices made are selected from a pool of two conditional and  two unconditional strategies, depending on the available memory  contents and phenotypic similarity among interactors. For the dominating  strategy in our standard model version, we found a strong dependence of  cooperation on network structure and a weak one on memory, whereas in  the modified version, the structural effect was weaker than that of  memory. Most importantly, we found that the previously reported decline  of cooperation in memory-based models, typically observed at a high  memory capacity, is now prevented with the help of tags. This suggests  that the evolutionary advantages of memory capacity limits may be far  more complex than previously assumed. For much smaller systems, we  observed a quasi-symmetric alternation of the two winning groups of  strategists. This result provides an example of ingroup biased  interactions that are characterized by bursts of intra-tag cooperation  interspersed with periods of unconditional transient altruism. Such  switches of strategies may represent a boosting mechanism necessary for  the emergence and stability of global altruism in its early evolutionary  stages.","1559":"a laboratory experiment has been designed to study coordination and cooperation in games played onlocal, random and small-world networks. for the coordination game, the results revealed a tendency for co-ordination on the payoff-dominant equilibrium in all three networks, but the frequency of payoff-dominantchoiceswassigni\ufb01cantlyhigherinsmall-worldnetworksthaninlocalandrandomnetworks.fortheprison-er\u2019s dilemma game, cooperation was hard to reach on all three networks, with average cooperation lower insmall-world networks than in random and local networks. two graph-theoretic characteristics\u2014clusteringcoef\ufb01cient and characteristic path length\u2014exhibited a signi\ufb01cant effect on individual behavior, possiblyexplaining why the small-world network, with its high clustering coef\ufb01cient and short path length, is thearchitecture of relations that drive a system towards equilibrium at the quickest pace.\u00a9 ","1560":"The  social brain hypothesis states that selection pressures associated with  complex social relationships have driven the evolution of sophisticated  cognitive processes in primates.

Here,  memory is greatly simplified and mapped onto a single parameter m describing the number of conspecifics whose previous action each individual can remember. We show that increasing m  enables cooperation to emerge and be maintained in groups of increasing  sizes. Furthermore, harsher social dilemmas lead to the need for a  higher m in order to ensure high levels of cooperation.

The present research examines whether cooperative  interaction can be affected by subtle activation (or priming) of  competence, and whether the effects may differ for competitive versus  prosocial participants. Consistent with hypotheses, two experiments  revealed that priming competence yielded reduced levels of cooperation  (and greater exploitation) among competitors, and yielded no effects  (Experiment 1) or a tendency towards enhanced cooperation (Experiment 2)  among prosocials.

Studies of cooperative  behaviour in humans invariably use economic games.

However, they usually rely on the  division of monetary tokens which are given to participants by the  investigator. The extent to which behaviour in such games may reflect  behaviour in the real world of biological markets \u2013 where money must be  earned and behavioural strategies incur real costs and benefits \u2013 is  unclear. To provide new data on the potential scale of this problem, we  investigated whether people behaved differently in two standard economic  games (public goods game and dictator game) when they had to earn their  monetary endowments through the completion of dull or physically  demanding tasks, as compared with simply being given the endowment. The  requirement for endowments to be \u2018earned\u2019 through labour did not affect  behaviour in the dictator game.

The prescriptions of traditional sex roles suggested  that Ss of both sexes would defect more (i.e., work less hard) with a  male partner than with a female partner, both when the partner presented  an opportunity to free ride and when the partner appeared to be  free-riding on the S's efforts. Results confirm this prediction. Male Ss  were less willing to free ride when the partner was female than male,  while females were more willing to free ride on their male partner than  on their female partner. In the sucker condition, both males and females  seemed to balk more at the prospect of carrying a male free rider than a  female free rider. Further analyses suggested that the effects should  not be attributed to perceived sex differences in task ability.  Plausible alternatives are discussed, including the possibility that  interaction with women, per se, encourages greater effort, regardless of  whether roles prescribe differential effort for the task.

Previous  research with social dilemma games has provided two choices, cooperative  and competitive, and the results have shown that most subjects attempt  to maximize selfish interests (respond competitively), resulting in an  outcome that is detrimental to collective welfare. The purpose of this  study was to assess the extent to which the introduction of an  alternative (compromise) choice would facilitate cooperative behavior.  Two experiments were conducted using three-person groups of  undergraduate males as subjects. Experiment 1 contrasted cooperative  choices in a two-choice game with a three-choice game, and as  hypothesized, the results showed significantly greater cooperation in  the three-choice game. Experiment 2 contrasted different types of  compromise choices in a three-choice game, and the results indicated  significantly different response proportions in these games. The  theoretical implications of these results are discussed in terms of  hypotheses proposed by Schelling, Platt, and Osgood.","1591":" This  study shows a public good experiment with four different treatments.  The payoff function is chosen so that the Nash equilibrium (NE) and the  collective optimum (CO) are both in the interior of the strategy space.  This study tries to test the effect of varying the level of the  collective optimum, which changes the \u2018social dilemma\u2019, involved  in the decision as to how much to contribute to the public good. The  results show that contributions increase with the level of the interior CO. There is overcontribution in comparison to the NE and undercontribution in comparison to the CO. But contributions are as far from the CO  as the level of the former increases. An overcontribution index that  takes into account the effective contribution relative to both the NE and the CO,  shows that subjects adopt a constant behaviour while passing from one  treatment to another: they contribute a constant share of the CO. ","1592":"Direct  reciprocity is a major mechanism for the evolution of cooperation.  Several classical studies have suggested that humans should quickly  learn to adopt reciprocal strategies to establish mutual cooperation in  repeated interactions. On the other hand, the recently discovered theory  of ZD strategies has found that subjects who use extortionate  strategies are able to exploit and subdue cooperators. Although such  extortioners have been predicted to succeed in any population of  adaptive opponents, theoretical follow-up studies questioned whether  extortion can evolve in reality. However, most of these studies presumed  that individuals have similar strategic possibilities and comparable  outside options, whereas asymmetries are ubiquitous in real world  applications. Here we show with a model and an economic experiment that  extortionate strategies readily emerge once subjects differ in their  strategic power. Our experiment combines a repeated social dilemma with  asymmetric partner choice. In our main treatment there is one randomly  chosen group member who is unilaterally allowed to exchange one of the  other group members after every ten rounds of the social dilemma. We  find that this asymmetric replacement opportunity generally promotes  cooperation, but often the resulting payoff distribution reflects the  underlying power structure. Almost half of the subjects in a better  strategic position turn into extortioners, who quickly proceed to  exploit their peers. By adapting their cooperation probabilities  consistent with ZD theory, extortioners force their co-players to  cooperate without being similarly cooperative themselves. Comparison to  non-extortionate players under the same conditions indicates a  substantial net gain to extortion. Our results thus highlight how power  asymmetries can endanger mutually beneficial interactions, and transform  them into exploitative relationships. In particular, our results  indicate that the extortionate strategies predicted from ZD theory could  play a more prominent role in our daily interactions than previously  thought. ","1593":"Iterated  games are a fundamental component of economic and evolutionary game  theory. They describe situations where two players interact repeatedly  and have the ability to use conditional strategies that depend on the  outcome of previous interactions, thus allowing for reciprocation.  Recently, a new class of strategies has been proposed, so-called  \u201czero-determinant\u201d strategies. These strategies enforce a fixed linear  relationship between one\u2019s own payoff and that of the other player. A  subset of those strategies allows \u201cextortioners\u201d to ensure that any  increase in one player\u2019s own payoff exceeds that of the other player by a  fixed percentage. Here, we analyze the evolutionary performance of this  new class of strategies. We show that in reasonably large populations,  they can act as catalysts for the evolution of cooperation, similar to  tit-for-tat, but that they are not the stable outcome of natural  selection. In very small populations, however, extortioners hold their  ground. Extortion strategies do particularly well in coevolutionary arms  races between two distinct populations. Significantly, they benefit the  population that evolves at the slower rate, an example of the so-called  \u201cRed King\u201d effect. This may affect the evolution of interactions  between host species and their endosymbionts.","1594":"Recent work has revealed a new class of \u201czero-determinant\u201d (ZD) strategies for iterated, two-player games. ZD  strategies allow a player to unilaterally enforce a linear relationship  between her score and her opponent\u2019s score, and thus to achieve an  unusual degree of control over both players\u2019 long-term payoffs. Although  originally conceived in the context of classical two-player game  theory, ZD strategies also have consequences in evolving populations of players. Here, we explore the evolutionary prospects for ZD  strategies in the Iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma (IPD). Several recent  studies have focused on the evolution of \u201cextortion strategies,\u201d a  subset of ZD strategies, and have found them to be unsuccessful in populations. Nevertheless, we identify a different subset of ZD strategies, called \u201cgenerous ZD  strategies,\u201d that forgive defecting opponents but nonetheless dominate  in evolving populations. For all but the smallest population sizes,  generous ZD strategies are not only robust to being replaced by other strategies but can selectively replace any noncooperative ZD strategy. Generous strategies can be generalized beyond the space of ZD  strategies, and they remain robust to invasion. When evolution occurs  on the full set of all IPD strategies, selection disproportionately  favors these generous strategies. In some regimes, generous strategies  outperform even the most successful of the well-known IPD strategies,  including win-stay-lose-shift.","1595":"Zero-determinant  (ZD) strategies, as discovered by Press and Dyson, can enforce a linear  relationship between a pair of players\u2019 scores in the iterated  prisoner\u2019s dilemma. Particularly, the extortionate ZD strategies can  enforce and exploit cooperation, providing a player with a score  advantage, and consequently higher scores than those from either mutual  cooperation or generous ZD strategies. In laboratory experiments in  which human subjects were paired with computer co-players, we  demonstrate that both the generous and the extortionate ZD strategies  indeed enforce a unilateral control of the reward. When the experimental  setting is sufficiently long and the computerized nature of the  opponent is known to human subjects, the extortionate strategy  outperforms the generous strategy. Human subjects\u2019 cooperation rates  when playing against extortionate and generous ZD strategies are similar  after learning has occurred. More than half of extortionate strategists  finally obtain an average score higher than that from mutual  cooperation.","1596":"['prisoner', 'dilemma', 'self', 'interest', 'clashes', 'collective', 'way', 'players', 'resolve', 'conflict', 'affects', 'others', 'view', 'cooperators', 'seen', 'more', 'moral', 'defectors', 'information', 'player', 'choice', 'equally', 'competent', 'defected', 'against', 'less', 'especially', 'if', 'themselves', 'cooperated', 'experiments', '1', '2', 'similarly', 'see', '3', 'independent', 'concerns', 'reputation', 'image', 'maintenance', 'evidential', 'reasoning', 'contributes', 'cooperative', 'behavior', 'project', 'own', 'attitudes', 'onto', 'likely', 'cooperate', 'classic', 'game', 'theory', 'reputational', 'better', 'equipped', 'explain', 'empirical', 'patterns', 'social', 'dilemmas']","1597":"  Abstract  Experiments on three two\u2010person threshold public good  provision games, namely, the simultaneous, sequential, and dictator  games, are conducted to explore the motives behind giving.

Dictators are indubitably endowed with complete  bargaining power. Since the differences between the bargaining powers of  two players increase from the simultaneous to the sequential to the  dictator game, comparisons among games allow us to trace whether the  contribution behavior is motivated by fairness or is simply due to the  strategic concern.

Overall, the heritability estimates were relatively small for each type  of decision, but heritability was greater when participants knew that  the others had made larger contributions. Using registered decisions in  Study 2, we conducted seven Monte Carlo simulations to examine genetic  and environmental influences on the expected game payoffs.

The authors  report an fMRI study of a 2-player coordination game in which players  must coordinate on an arbitrary convention (a left or right button  press) to obtain monetary rewards. Once this convention has been  established, one of the participants is incentivized to deviate from the  equilibrium with the offer of extra reward. During the period prior to  decisions to violate the convention, activity was observed in regions  associated with reward processing, such as the midbrain, caudate, and  orbitofrontal cortex.

In the present study, we use a repeated  multiplayer prisoner\u2019s dilemma game and the repeated public goods game  played by human participants to examine whether MCC is observed across  different types of game and the possibility that reinforcement learning  explains observed behavior. We observed MCC behavior in both games, but  the MCC that we observed was different from that observed in the past  experiments. In the present study, whether or not a focal participant  cooperated previously affected the overall level of cooperation, instead  of changing the tendency of cooperation in response to cooperation of  other participants in the previous time step.

The  hypotheses we examine argue that despite the differences between  socio-economic and political settings, (1) endogenous rule-crafting can  help water users to overcome appropriation and provision dilemmas in  water-scarce environments like in the East Mediterranean countries and  that (2) in market-like water governance systems, institutions other  than the market itself, are less influential for overcoming  appropriation and provision dilemmas than in hybrid governance systems.  These hypotheses are being tested comparing the results of field  experiments conducted in Jordan, the Republic of Cyprus and North Cyprus  with 70 farmers. Field experiments simulate asymmetric access to  resources and are based on variations of the irrigation game by Cardenas  et al. to model and test asymmetric distribution of investment, harvest  and revenue that favours upstream users. Empirical evidence shows that  externally imposed allocation rules are able to bring in more equal  distribution of revenue among upstream\u2013downstream users but is likely to  reduce the volume of investment and revenue, without resolving issues  of free-riding. The authors argue that given the opportunity, water  users (small farmers in our experiments) are able to craft their own  rules improving the overall performance of the group in terms of  investment and revenue, with a parallel improvement of equity in  distribution. The implications and policy relevance of such findings are  briefly discussed as they contradict typical practices of top-down  policy delivery in the selected cases.","1626":"It  is often assumed that irrigation systems require a central authority to  solve coordination problems due to the asymmetry in position and  influence between those located at the head-end of a system and those  located at the tail-end. However, many examples of complex irrigation  systems exist that are self-organized without central coordination.  Field experiments on asymmetric commons dilemmas are performed with  villagers in rural Colombia and Thailand. Our experiments show that  there is a dynamic interaction between equality in the use of the common  resource, and the level of the contributions to the creation of a  common resource. Inequality in the distribution of benefits in one round  triggers lower levels of group contributions, reducing efficiency and  triggering even more inequality in contributions and distribution of the  resource among players.The upstream players act as  \u201cstationary bandits\u201d. They take more than an equal share of the common  resource, but leave sufficient resources for the downstream players to  stimulate them to continue their contributions to the public  infrastructure.After 10 rounds, players can vote on  one of three allocation rules: equal quota, random and rotating access  to appropriation of the resource. The rotating access is most often  elected. The resource dynamics in the second part of the experiment  depend on the rule elected. With the quota rule, the stationary bandit  metaphor is less relevant since taking equal shares of the resource is  enforced. With the rotation access rule, the players act strategically  on the rotating position. They invest more when having the first access  to the resource compared to less favorable access.

As part of two related research projects that focus on  how subtle social and environmental contextual variables affect the  evolution and performance of institutional rules, several sets of  experiments have been performed in laboratory settings at Arizona State  University and in field settings in rural villages in Thailand and  Colombia. In these experiments, participants make both a decision about  how much to invest in public infrastructure and how much to extract from  the resources generated by that public infrastructure. With both  studies we find that head-enders act as stationary bandits. They do take  unequal shares of the common-pool resource but if their share is very  large relative to downstream participants' shares, the latter will  revolt. Therefore for groups to be successful, head-enders must restrain  themselves in their use of their privileged access to the common-pool  resource.

We conducted a series of experiments to test this question and to understand mechanisms contributing to potential differences. We found that representatives contributed less than individuals when they could not communicate with their constituency. However, when they could discuss their strategy before playing, they contributed at least as much as individual decision-makers. Furthermore, when they could justify their decision after playing, they contributed even more than individual decision-makers.

We develop a new  three-choice matrix to differentiate max own from max rel  competitiveness. Experiment 1 revealed that groups selected more max own  and more max rel than individuals. Experiment 2 enabled a more careful  examination of the development of max rel. The results show that max rel  emerged only after some experience with competitive relations. and that  one reason for the initial reluctance to select max rel was the  associated own sacrifice.

We develop a model in which individuals  self-sanction (e.g. feel guilty) for contributing less than a subjective  norm level of contribution to a public good. From the model we derive  the following testable hypotheses: an increase in one's perception of  the norm level of contribution to the public good (1) induces negative  self-sanctioning and (2) will lead one to contribute more to the public  good, and (3) that contributing to the public good induces positive  self-sanctioning. To test these hypotheses, we elicit stated preferences  for contributions to an organization which offsets carbon emissions and  a proxy for self-sanctioning, respondent \u201cself-image.\u201d We fail to  reject each hypothesis. Our results complement existing studies on how  to encourage contributions to the public good.","1632":"Social  order is possible only if individuals forgo the narrow pursuit of  self-interest for the greater good. For over a century, social  scientists have argued that sympathy mitigates self-interest and recent  empirical work supports this claim. Much less is known about why actors  experience sympathy in the first place, particularly in fleeting  interactions with strangers, where cooperation is especially uncertain.  We argue that perceived interdependence increases sympathy towards  strangers. Results from our first study, a vignette experiment, support  this claim and suggests a situational solution to social dilemmas.  Meanwhile, previous work points to two strong individual-level  predictors of cooperation: generalized trust and social values. In Study  Two we address the intersection of situational and individual-level  explanations to ask: does situational sympathy mediate these  individual-level predictors of cooperation? Results from the second  study, a laboratory experiment, support our hypotheses that sympathy  mediates the generalized trust-cooperation link and the relationship  between social values and cooperation.

The results indicated that subjects receiving full  instructions, including warnings about the social traps, avoid the  social traps more frequently than those receiving minimal instructions.  However, the differences in frequencies of cooperative choices were all  slight except for the strong version of Prisoner's Dilemma.

In public  goods games, i.e. the experimental paradigm for studying the  sustainability of a public resource with human subjects, initial  cooperation usually declines quickly. Recently, it has been shown that  the interaction with another social game in which good reputation  attracts help, can maintain a high level of cooperation in the public  goods game. Here we show experimentally that humans use different  strategies in the public goods game conditional on whether the player  knows that his decisions will be either known or unknown in another  social game. The knowledge of being recognized as the same individual in  both scenarios motivates players to invest in their reputation and thus  sustain the public resource. However, cooperation declines immediately  when individual identities switch from being recognizable to being  unrecognizable between the two interacting games.","1645":"Shame  and honor are mechanisms that expose behavior that falls outside the  social norm.

In the shame  treatment, the least cooperative players were exposed and wrote their  names under the sentence \u201cI donated least\u201d while the honored  participants wrote their name under \u201cI donated most.\u201d In both the shame  and honor treatments, participants contributed approximately 50% more to  the public good, as compared with the control treatment in which all  players retained their anonymity.

In this study, we used an electroencephalography  (EEG) hyperscanning approach to investigate the effect of face-to-face  contact on the brain mechanisms underlying the decision to cooperate or  defect in an iterated version of the Prisoner's Dilemma Game.  Participants played the game either in face-to-face or face-blocked  conditions. The face-to-face interaction led players to cooperate more  often, providing behavioral evidence for the use of these nonverbal cues  in their social decision-making. In addition, the EEG  hyperscanning identified temporal dynamics and inter-brain  synchronization across the cortex, providing evidence for involvement of  these regions in the processing of face-to-face cues to read each  other's intent to cooperate. Most notably, the power of the alpha  frequency band (8\u201313\u00a0Hz) in the right temporoparietal region  immediately after seeing a round outcome significantly differed between  face-to-face and face-blocked conditions and predicted whether an  individual would adopt a \u2018cooperation\u2019 or \u2018defection\u2019 strategy.  Moreover, inter-brain synchronies within this time and frequency range  reflected the use of these strategies. This study provides evidence for  how the cortex uses nonverbal social cues to determine other's  intentions, and highlights the significance of power in the alpha band  and inter-brain phase synchronizations in high-level socio-cognitive  processing.","1647":"Understanding  the neural mechanisms responsible for human social interactions is  difficult, since the brain activities of two or more individuals have to  be examined simultaneously and correlated with the observed social  patterns.

Graph analysis of hyper-brain networks  constructed from the EEG scanning of 26 couples of individuals playing  the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma reveals the possibility to predict  non-cooperative interactions during the decision-making phase. The  hyper-brain networks of two-defector couples have significantly less  inter-brain links and overall higher modularity\u2014i.e., the tendency to  form two separate subgraphs\u2014than couples playing cooperative or  tit-for-tat strategies.

","1669":"Explaining  cooperation remains a central topic for evolutionary theorists. Many  have argued that group selection provides such an explanation:  theoretical models show that intergroup competition could have given  rise to cooperation that is costly for the individual. Whether group  selection actually did play an important role in the evolution of human  cooperation, however, is much debated. Recent experiments have shown  that intergroup competitions do increase human cooperation, which has  been taken as evidence for group selection as a mechanism for the  evolution of cooperation. Here we challenge this standard  interpretation. Competitions change the payoff structure by creating a  threshold effect whereby the group that contributes more earns an  additional prize, which creates some incentive for individuals to  cooperate. We present four studies that disentangle competition and  thresholds, and strongly suggest that it is thresholds \u2013 rather than  competitions per se \u2013 that increase cooperation. Thus, prior intergroup  competition experiments provide no evidence of a unique or special role  for intergroup competition in promoting human cooperation, and shed no  light on whether group selection shaped human evolution.","1670":"There  is growing recognition in both evolutionary biology and anthropology  that dispersal is key to establishing patterns of cooperation. However,  some models predict that cooperation is more likely to evolve in low  dispersal (viscous) populations, while others predict that local  competition for resources inhibits cooperation. Sex-biased dispersal and  extra-pair mating may also have an effect. Using economic games in  Sino-Tibetan populations with strikingly different dispersal patterns,  we measure cooperation in 36 villages in southwestern China; we test  whether social structure is associated with cooperative behaviour toward  those in the neighbourhood. We find that social organization is  associated with levels of cooperation in public goods and dictator games  and a resource dilemma; people are less cooperative towards other  villagers in communities where dispersal by both sexes is low. This  supports the view that dispersal for marriage played an important role  in the evolution of large-scale cooperation in human society.","1671":"The  success or failure of human collective action often depends on the  cooperation tendencies of individuals in groups, and on the information  that individuals have about each other\u2019s cooperativeness. However, it is  unclear whether these two factors have an interactive effect on  cooperation dynamics. Using a decision-making experiment, we confirm  that groups comprising individuals with higher cooperation tendencies  cooperate at a higher level than groups comprising individuals with low  cooperation tendencies. Moreover, assorting individuals with similar  cooperation tendency together affected behaviour so that the most  cooperative individuals tended to cooperate more and the least  cooperative individuals cooperated less, compared to their behaviour in  randomly formed groups. In line with predictions of evolutionary models  of cooperation, there was a strong positive association between  individuals\u2019 cooperation tendency and success when groups were formed  assortatively, whereas such association did not exist when groups were  formed randomly. Surprisingly, information about group members\u2019  cooperativeness in assorted groups had no effect on cooperation levels.  We discuss potential explanations for why information about  cooperativeness of others may be disregarded in certain circumstances. ","1672":"Many  experiments on human cooperation have revealed that individuals differ  systematically in their tendency to cooperate with others. It has also  been shown that individuals condition their behaviour on the overall  cooperation level of their peers. Yet, little is known about how  individuals respond to heterogeneity in cooperativeness in their  neighbourhood. Here, we present an experimental study investigating  whether and how people respond to heterogeneous behaviour in a public  goods game. We find that a large majority of subjects does respond to  heterogeneity in their group, but they respond in quite different ways.  Most subjects contribute less to the public good when the contributions  of their peers are more heterogeneous, but a substantial fraction of  individuals consistently contributes more in this case. In addition, we  find that individuals that respond positively to heterogeneity have a  higher general cooperation tendency.

Furthermore, experiments which have  been aimed at evaluating the predictive power of this theory have failed  to use methods which permit the detailed analysis of interdependent  decision processes. It is suggested that digital computers can be used  to solve this methodological problem by having the machine interact,  according to predetermined strategies, with human subjects. An experiment was conducted to investigate the structure of  interdependent strategies in an effort to illuminate the psychological  processes involved. In order to construct an experimental task in which  both interdependence and experimental control of the form of the  interdependence would be possible, a small digital computer was  programmed to play zero\u2010sum games against human subjects. The machine  was programmed to play the game according to three different strategies.  The first of these was the minimax strategy. The second program  employed a strategy which kept a record of the number of times the  subject chose each response and used this information to compute, on  each trial, an estimate of the expected loss associated with each of its  choices. On each trial, the program chose the response having the least  expected loss. The third program generated its choices in the same  manner as the previous one, except that it only \u201cremembers\u201d the five  most recent choices of the subject to use as estimates of choice  probabilities in computing the expected losses. This program thus had a  limited memory. Fourteen human subjects played a zero\u2010sum game against each  of these programs for a total of 150 trials. The sequence of choices for  each subject was analyzed in an effort to determine how the different  strategies used by the machine affected the strategies used by the  subjects. The analyses indicated that the decision strategies adopted  by the subjects depended critically on the strategy used by the  computer. The subjects' strategies were effective, although not strictly  optimal, against those of the machine. The results reveal a level of  complexity not previously observed in the study of interdependent  decision processes and some implications of these results for theory  construction are discussed.

In our  research, we anticipated that environmentalists\u2014people with an  inclination for pro\u2010environmental engagement\u2014would possess a propensity  to generally act prosocially.

Based on subjects\u2019 degree of environmental  engagement, originally established in 2003, we re\u2010contacted a sample of  502 persons in 2005. Of these 502 (68.5% low, 31.5% high in  environmentalism), 131 showed up for the announced experiment. Among  those participants, we found that environmentalists\u2019 prosocial  personalities were additionally reflected in their social value  orientations. Ninety percent of the environmentalists turned out to be  prosocials, whereas only 65% of the less environmentally engaged  subjects were prosocials. Overall, our findings lend credit to a notion  of environmentalism as an indicator of even subtle quantitative  differences in a person's prosocial trait level. By and large,  environmentalists acted more prosocially even in mundane activities  unrelated to environmental conservation. Additional evidence comes from  the commons dilemma experiment in which the participants partook. There,  we generally found comparatively more cooperation with others for the  collective good from people high in environmentalism. Our findings  represent circumstantial evidence for a prosocial propensity dimension  along which people differ, and which is also reflected in people's  pro\u2010environmental behavioral performance. If, however, environmentalism  has to be regarded as indicative of a prosocial trait rather than a  state\u2010like motive, high hopes for moral norms and other prosocial  motives in environmental conservation do not seem warranted.

Recent developments in evolutionary psychology suggest that the anomaly  may be attributable to evolutionary constraints on the human brain and  their interaction with general intelligence. We conduct a laboratory  experiment to test three hypotheses: (a) projection of a video image of  another experimental subject increases cooperation because the human  brain implicitly assumes that their choice is not anonymous; (b) more  intelligent individuals are more likely to defect, because they are more  likely to comprehend the evolutionarily novel features of the  experiment that make defection rational; and (c) the effect of the video  projection on cooperation is greater among less intelligent  individuals. The experiment clearly supports two of the three  hypotheses.

We perform the  first series of laboratory experiments that can separately estimate the  impact of these two social effects, and test whether realized influence  is consistent with the desire to influence, and whether either of these  are consistent with anticipated influence.

Prior to play, 92 university  student players completed the State\u2010Trait Anger Expression Inventory.  They were then paired to play the IPD against partners of similar or  dissimilar trait anger levels. At postplay, the State Anger scale was  readministered. Results showed significant preplay to postplay increases  in state anger, with greater increases shown by high trait anger  players. Thus, high trait anger players were especially subject to  arousal. Players in the high trait anger group made more  competitive\/attack responses, and they were more likely to do so when  paired with a high trait anger partner. As a result of the high level of  competitive\/aggressive play, both groups ended with a negative troop  count. Trait anger as a general personality temperament was predictive  of state anger, competitive\/attack responses, and the number of trials  before a retaliation was made. The expressive style of anger\u2010control was  also related to manner of play. Trait anger had strong direct and  indirect effects through anger control on the number of competitive  attack responses.

This impulsive behavior has implications for several behavioral problems  including social cooperation. This paper presents two experiments using  captive blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) that consider the  effects of payoff accumulation and temporal clumping on impulsiveness  and cooperation. Payoff accumulation refers to a situation where the  benefits gained from each choice trial accumulate from one trial to the  next, and only become available to the animal after it has completed a  fixed number of trials. We hypothesized that this would reduce  impulsiveness because it removes the advantage of quickly realizing food  gains. Clumping refers to situation in which the animal experiences  several choice trials in quick succession followed by a long pause  before the next clump. We hypothesized that if payoffs accumulated over a  clump of trials this would enhance the effect of accumulation. We  tested the effects of accumulation and clumping on impulsiveness in a  self-control situation. We found a significant interaction between  clumping and accumulation. Payoff accumulation reduced impulsiveness,  but only when trials were clumped. Post hoc analyses suggest that  clumping alone increases impulsiveness. A second experiment applied  these results to cooperation. This experiment reveals an interaction  between payoff accumulation and trial's position within the clump. Jays  were more likely to cooperate on the first trial of a clump, but the  likelihood of cooperation dropped after the first trial. However, this  drop was larger when payoffs did not accumulate. This observation  suggests that the difference between accumulated and unaccumulated  treatments that we reported previously (Science 198: 2216\u20132218) may be largely due to differences in how animals behave in the first trial of a clump.","1698":"Social  dilemmas are characterized by conflicts between immediate self-interest  and long-term collective goals.

We administered the Pizzagame to  a sample of 191 children 9 to 16\u00a0years of age. Subjects were led  to believe they were playing the game over the Internet with three sets  of two same-aged, same-sex co-players.

Supporting  the validity of the Pizzagame, our results revealed that children and  adolescents displayed conditional cooperation, such that their  contributions rose with the increasing cooperativeness of their  co-players. Age and gender did not influence children and adolescents\u2019  cooperative behavior within each condition. However, older children  adapted their behavior more flexibly between conditions to parallel the  strategies of their co-players.

Peer punishment mechanisms  have garnered particular attention and suggest that groups are able to  self-govern. Research suggests that the effectiveness of peer punishment  depends on a group\u2019s capacity to establish and enforce contribution  norms. This paper investigates the effectiveness of such institutions  when normative conflict makes contribution norms ambiguous. In an  interior solution public good experiment, endowment heterogeneity and  peer punishment are interacted. Results suggest that peer punishment  induces greater contributions when endowments are homogeneous but does  not increase contributions when endowments are heterogeneous. Across the  payoff equivalent endowment conditions with the opportunity to punish,  contributions and earnings are significantly lower when endowments are  heterogeneous. This research suggests that the capacity of groups to  self-govern is limited when normative conflict makes contribution norms  ambiguous.","1721":"Highlights\u2022Paper investigates a central authority institution within a linear public good game.\u2022Deterrence is determined by the number of group members who may be monitored.\u2022Monitoring each additional group member is costly and increases the fixed cost of the institution.\u2022Deterrence  is both exogenously and endogenously determined across treatments.

This cooperation  divergence may be explained by a behavioral asymmetry between the  warm-glow of doing something good and the cold-prickle of doing  something bad (Andreoni, 1995).  However, recent research suggests that behavior is qualitatively  similar across payoff equivalent public good and common pool resource  experiments (Apesteguia &amp; Maier-Rigaud, 2006).  This paper reports on an experiment designed to test the robustness of  the cooperation divergence. The analysis quantifies the cooperation  across payoff equivalent public good and common pool resource  experiments that explicitly inform subjects how their allocation  decisions effect group earnings. Results suggest that the level of  cooperation is equivalent across treatments. This research suggests that  the observed cooperation divergence is caused, in part, by variation in  the experimental parameters employed rather than from a behavioral  regularity unexplained by standard theory.","1723":"Since  decades, cross-cultural psychology examines moral values using data  from standardized surveys, assuming that values guide human behavior. We  add to this literature by studying the link between moral values and  various forms of prosocial behavior, using data from respondents of the  sixth World Values Survey in Germany who participated in an online  behavioral experiment. The experiment consists of a series of  incentivized tasks and allows us to elaborate the association between  survey-measured values and three facets of observed prosocial behavior.  The evidence boils down to three findings. While (a) emancipative values  relate to higher common pool contributions and (b) higher donations to  charitable organizations, (c) secular values are linked with more  productive and less protective investments. As these results conform to  key theories and reach empirical significance in a major postindustrial  nation, we conclude that we have important evidence at hand highlighting  the potential of combined survey-experiment methods to establish  value\u2013behavior links that are otherwise inexplorable.","1724":"  Abstract  Two studies investigated how values affect competitive  versus cooperative behavior.

The Paired Charity  Game (Study 1) framed the situation in terms of cooperation. As  hypothesized, contribution correlated positively with universalism and  benevolence values that reflect concern for others and negatively with  power, achievement, and hedonism values that promote self\u2010interests.  Furthermore, values, but not traits, predicted the participants'  contribution. The Group Charity Game (Study 2) was designed to frame the  situation in terms of competition. As hypothesized, contribution  correlated positively with emphasizing benevolence over power values.  Moreover, the impact of values was stronger when they were rendered  accessible, indicating a causal influence of values on behavior.  Furthermore, when their value hierarchy was rendered accessible,  participants explained their choices in terms of those values that were  (a) important to them and (b) relevant to the situation. The findings  thus point to the mechanism through which accessible values affect  behavior.

However, PEB and in-group  cooperation can also be mutually exclusive or directly conflict. To  provide first evidence on behavior in these situations, the present work  develops the Greater Good Game (GGG), a social dilemma  paradigm with a selfish, a cooperative, and a pro-environmental choice  option. In Study 1, the GGG and a corresponding measurement model were  experimentally validated using different payoff structures. Results show  that in-group cooperation is the dominant behavior in a situation of  mutual exclusiveness, whereas selfish behavior becomes more dominant in a  situation of conflict. Study 2 examined personality influences on  choices in the GGG. High Honesty-Humility was associated with less  selfishness, whereas Openness was not associated with more PEB.

The resources of the subject's  own subgroup started at the individual, subgroup, or collective level,  and the resources of the opposing subgroup also started at the  individual, subgroup, or collective level. The condition in which both  subgroups' resources began at the collective level was similar to a  traditional commons dilemma, while the condition in which both  subgroups' resources began at the individual level was similar to a  traditional public goods problem. The other conditions were new to this  research domain. We found higher allocations to the collective account  when the initial resource location was the same for both subgroups  (versus different for each subgroup), even when this initial location  was the subgroup or individual level.

However, the possibility of punishment of the co-players  can result in antisocial punishment, the punishment of those players who  contribute the most in the group. To better understand why antisocial  punishment exists, it must be determined who are the anti-social  punishers and who are their primary targets.   Methods For  resolving these questions we increased the number of players in a group  from usual four to twelve. Each group played six rounds of the standard  Public Goods Game and six rounds of the Public Goods Game with  punishment. Each player in each round received 20 CZK ($ 1.25).

In the current paper, we argue that people may  readily accept such financial differences in interest when their social  needs are met by being accepted by the others. When people are socially  rejected, however, members having a low rather than a high interest in  the public good may display negative emotional and retributive  reactions. This reasoning was supported by the findings of a first  experimental study in which we manipulated people's interest in the  public good and social rejection. These effects were replicated in a  second experimental study and it was further shown that this two\u2010way  interaction between social rejection and interest in the public good was  moderated by people's social value orientation. The negative reactions  to low interest (vs. high interest) in the public good when being  socially rejected were especially prominent among group members with a  proself orientation.

The model helps us understand why players  of Assurance often appear to take risks in order to \u201ctest the waters\u201d  with cooperative moves, and why the problem posed for collective action  is sometimes successfully resolved.","1752":"A  classic problem in the literature on authority is that those with the  power to enforce cooperation and proper norms of conduct can also abuse  or misuse their power. The present research tested the argument that  concerns about legitimacy can help regulate the use of power to punish  by invoking a sense of what is morally right or socially proper for  power-holders. We tested this idea in a laboratory experiment using  public goods games in which one person in each group was selected to be a  \u201cdesignated punisher\u201d who could give out material punishment that was  either costly or costless to the punisher. Results show that costly  punishment is perceived as more legitimate (proper) than costless  punishment and that designated punishers engaged in more proper  (\u201cprosocial\u201d) punishment and less abusive (\u201cantisocial\u201d) punishment when  punishment was costly. These results highlight the importance of  legitimacy in both motivating and regulating the enforcement of  cooperation.","1753":"Highlights\u2022This paper focuses on the general preference for rewarding cooperation over punishing non-cooperation.\u2022We propose that responsibility for the harm done has a self-restraining impact on the willingness to punish.\u2022Individuals\u2019 reluctance to punish non-cooperation was stronger than for groups.\u2022The willingness to reward cooperation did not differ between individuals and groups.\u2022The effect of grouping individuals was mediated by feelings of personal responsibility.AbstractTo  promote cooperation, people often rely on the administration of  sanctions. However, from previous research we know that those in control  of sanctions are generally reluctant to punish non-cooperative choice  behavior and prefer to reward cooperative choice behavior, which is  consistent with the do-no-harm principle. We propose that people are  reluctant to punish because they feel personally responsible for the  harm done. As such, we argue and demonstrate that the relative  preference for rewarding over punishing is more pronounced when people  decide individually than jointly (Experiment 1 and 2). Moreover, we show  that the effect of grouping individuals on the reluctance to punish is  mediated by feelings of personal responsibility (Experiment 3). These  findings corroborate our reasoning that the feeling of personal  responsibility has a self-restraining impact on the willingness to  punish those who impair others\u2019 interests, but not on the willingness to  reward those who serve others\u2019 interests.","1754":"We  examine how the timing of trust violations affects cooperation and  solidarity, including trust and relational cohesion. Past studies that  used repeated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemmas suggest that trust violations are more  harmful when they occur in early rather than later interactions. We  argue that this effect of early trust violations depends on cultural and  individual differences in generalized trust. A laboratory study from  high- and low-trust cultures (the United States vs. Japan) supported our  claim. First, early trust violations were more harmful than late trust  violations, but only for Americans; the pattern reversed for Japanese.  Second, these patterns were mediated by individual differences in  generalized trust. Finally, generalized trust also moderated the effect  of trust violations in the United States but not Japan. By demonstrating  that generalized trust is not only lower but also less important in  low-trust cultures, our research advances our understanding of how  culture affects the development of solidarity in exchange relations.","1755":"i n two experiments, we investigated a how priming european identity as common project versus common heritageaffects participants\u2019 cooperation in social dilemma; an additional aim was to explore the mediators involved inthe process. in the first experiment, 82 students played a public good dilemma with a european bogus partner andthen completed self-report measures of identification with the european union (eu), group-based trust and collectiveinterest. results showed that priming a common project-based but not a common heritage-based european social identityfosteredcooperativebehaviour;thiseffectwasmediatedbytwosequentialmediators:thecommonprojectprimeincreasedparticipants\u2019strengthofidentificationwitheu(mediator1)which,inturn,positivelyaffectedgroup-basedtrust(mediator2), fostering greater cooperation. experiment 2 was conducted with a similar procedure on a sample of 124 students,using a different measure of trust and changing the order of mediators. results supported those of previous experiment:priming a project-based eu identity content (compared to heritage-based one) had significant direct and indirect effectson cooperation.","1756":"Highlights\u2022Neural &amp; behavioural effects of intranasal oxytocin depend on the decision context.\u2022In coordination games oxytocin facilitates cooperation for risk averse individuals.\u2022Here oxytocin (but not placebo) activates the nucleus accumbens.\u2022In anti-coordination games with neutral face cues oxytocin facilitates aggression.\u2022Here oxytocin (but not placebo) attenuates the amygdala.AbstractWe investigate if the neuropeptide oxytocin  (OT), known to moderate social behaviour, influences strategic decision  making in social dilemmas by facilitating the integration of incentives  and social cues. Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a029) played two economic games with different incentive structures in the fMRI  scanner after receiving OT or placebo (following a double blind,  within-subject design). Pictures of angry or neutral faces (the social  cues) were displayed alongside the game matrices. Consistent with a  priori hypotheses based on the modulatory role of OT in mesolimbic dopaminergic brain regions, the results indicate that, compared to placebo, OT significantly increases the activation of the nucleus accumbens  during an assurance (coordination) game that rewards mutual  cooperation. This increases appetitive motivation so that cooperative  behaviour is facilitated for risk averse individuals. OT also  significantly attenuates the amygdala,  thereby reducing the orienting response to social cues. The  corresponding change in behaviour is only apparent in the chicken (or  anti-coordination) game, where aggression is incentivized but fatal if  the partner also aggresses. Because of this ambiguity, decision making  can be improved by additional information, and OT steers decisions in  the chicken game in accordance with the valence of the facial cue:  aggress when face is neutral; retreat when it is angry. Through its  combined influence on amygdala and nucleus accumbens, OT improves the  selection of a cooperative or aggressive strategy in function of the  best match between the incentives of the game and the social cues  present in the decision environment.","1757":"This  paper investigated the effect of risk orientation, game riskiness, and  expectation of cooperation on cooperation in one-shot prisoner\u2019s  dilemmas (PD).

They estimated how likely it was that  the other player was going to cooperate (expectation of cooperation)  before they made their cooperation\/defection decision on each game.  Supporting the Goal\/Expectation Hypothesis, we replicated the effect  that expectation of cooperation enhanced cooperation. We also found that  risk-seeking individuals cooperated more in more risky games whereas  risk-averse individuals cooperated more in less risky games. More  importantly, we found that game riskiness moderated the effect of  expectation of cooperation on cooperation. The positive effect of  expectation of cooperation on cooperation was stronger for more risky  games than for less risky games.

In particular, memory would be important  because cooperation can emerge and be maintained only if the same  opponents interact repeatedly and adjust their decisions to their  opponent\u2019s previous move. To investigate how these constraints influence  reciprocity, we first conducted a preliminary foraging experiment with  zebra finches (Taeniapygia guttata ) to insure that  corticosterone elevations impaired the birds\u2019 event memory capabilities.  Then, we performed a reciprocity experiment with established pairs that  were tested in a two\u2010choice apparatus under two different conditions:  once with an empty implant and once with an implant of corticosterone.  We found that the birds were capable of sustained cooperation in the  Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma treatment but only when they had an empty implant.  Thus, our results support the hypothesis that limitations in event  memory constraint the frequency of reciprocity and hence would make this  form of cooperation difficult for non\u2010human animals. In addition, as  levels of stress hormones can differ greatly among individuals, our  findings might also contribute explaining individual variation in the  propensity to cooperate.   ","1763":"Reciprocal  altruism, one of the most probable explanations for cooperation among  non-kin, has been modelled as a Prisoner's Dilemma. According to this  game, cooperation could evolve when individuals, who expect to play  again, use conditional strategies like tit-for-tat or Pavlov. There is  evidence that humans use such strategies to achieve mutual cooperation,  but most controlled experiments with non-human animals have failed to  find cooperation. One reason for this could be that subjects fail to  cooperate because they behave as if they were to play only once. To  assess this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment with monogamous zebra  finches (Taeniopygia guttata) that were tested in a two-choice  apparatus, with either their social partner or an experimental opponent  of the opposite sex. We found that zebra finches maintained high levels  of cooperation in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game only when  interacting with their social partner. Although other mechanisms may  have contributed to the observed difference between the two treatments,  our results support the hypothesis that animals do not systematically  give in to the short-term temptation of cheating when long-term benefits  exist. Thus, our findings contradict the commonly accepted idea that  reciprocal altruism will be rare in non-human animals.","1764":"nan","1765":"43 female Ss and 46 male Ss  played three Prisoner's Dilemma games.

The expectation-based  hypothesis argues that different languages will induce different  expectations regarding the choices of others and affect behavior. We  test these two hypotheses using an extensive range of behaviors in a set  of incentivized experiments with bilingual subjects in Chinese and  English.

Simulation studies of the prisoner's dilemma, where players  make probabilistic choices based on previous actions, find that  strategies such as win-stay-lose-shift,  tit-for-tat, and firm-but-fair  come to dominate the long-term behavior of the population. Often, these  models assume that decisions are made in synchrony.

This study investigated  the relationship between social and non-social deficits in children with  HFA and the cooperative behaviors of such children. Theory of mind  (ToM), executive function, and central coherence of children with HFA  and typically developing (TD) children, aged 6\u201312 years, were  investigated, and the effects of these social and non-social deficits on  children's cooperativeness were examined. The classical prisoner's  dilemma game (PDG) and cooperative implemental tasks were used to assess  children's cooperativeness. ToM was measured using a series of  classical false belief tasks and the face test. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) and the Embedded Figures Test  (EFT) were administered to assess executive function and central  coherence, respectively. The results showed that there was no  significant difference in cooperation in PDG between HFA and TD  children, while cooperation in children with HFA in the interruption  period of the implemental tasks was significantly lower than that of TD  children. Children with HFA had social deficits and had more poorly  developed ToM than TD children, and executive function in children with  HFA was poorer than that in TD children. Different types of deficits  were predictive of HFA children's degree of cooperation on different  tasks: the social perceptual component of ToM and executive function  predicted children's cooperativeness in the PDG, and executive function  predicted HFA children's cooperativeness during the interruption period  of an implemental task.

The  internalized reciprocity norm assumption suggests that reciprocity  disposition would encourage reciprocity towards strangers in one-shot  interactions. To verify this, we examined the predictive ability of  reciprocity dispositions for giving and repaying reciprocal behaviors. A  sample of college students (N\u00a0=\u00a098) participated in  the reciprocity game in a laboratory, which comprised a prisoner dilemma  game (PD) and dictator game (DG). The results indicated that  reciprocity behavior occurred among strangers without face-to-face  interactions. Reciprocity expectation predicted the choice of  cooperation in the PD significantly. Positive and negative reciprocity  dispositions had no effect on the strategy choice; however, they  significantly predicted payoff allocation in the DG. Specifically, a  higher positive reciprocity disposition led to more payoff allocation,  while a higher negative reciprocity disposition led to less payoff  allocation. In summary, strangers abide by the reciprocity norm, and the  internalized reciprocity disposition exerts an influence on repaying  behavior and accounts for some individual differences in reciprocity.  These findings provide robust support for the internalized reciprocity  norm assumption, and illustrate the process mechanism of human  interaction among strangers. People may predict interpersonal  interaction better through reciprocity dispositions and reciprocity  valences.","1778":"Highlights\u2022Players had a helpful or unhelpful video game teammate or minimal in-group member.\u2022Players engaged in a simultaneous or sequential PDG with teammate and opposing team.\u2022Helpful teammates confirmed reciprocity expectations and increased pro-socialness.\u2022Unhelpful teammates had the opposite effect on pro-socialness between teammates.\u2022Playing with a helpful teammate increased pro-socialness toward out-group members.AbstractThe  theory of Bounded Generalized Reciprocity was examined to help explain  why cooperative video game play can increase players\u2019 subsequent pro-social behaviors.

Playing  with an unhelpful teammate disconfirmed expectations of in-group members  to reciprocate pro-social behaviors and led to decreases in pro-social  behaviors between teammates.

Focusing on the  involved conflict between strategic and moral incentives, we designed a  two-stage experiment to analyse both the subjects\u2019 judgement (Part 1)  and their behaviour (Part 2) in such a setting. In Part 1, we elicited  the subjects\u2019 preferences over the different outcomes in the Prisoner\u2019s  Dilemma from three different perspectives (moral, strategic, overall).  In Part 2, conducted some months later, we let them decide on actions in  the respective context. The data show that: (a) subjects can  differentiate between moral and strategic incentives; (b) overall  preferences are often a combination of moral and strategic preferences;  (c) the subjects\u2019 expressed preferences over outcomes are closely  aligned with specific personal values; (d) actual behaviour in the lab  is primarily determined by the subjects\u2019 (pessimistic) first order  beliefs.

This paper aims to close this gap by  means of a systematic content analysis of communication transcripts  from field experiments. The paper analyzes communication statements  shared by participants in a series of common-pool resource experiments  conducted in rural Colombia.

According to our results, statements that contain references  to the context affect cooperation depending on the function of those  statements. When the statements fulfill an information role, the effect  is negative, but when statements have the function of enhancing group  solidarity, the effect is positive. The statements that have the  strongest positive impact on cooperation are those fulfilling a  disapproval function, particularly when the topic of the messages are  the payoffs obtained by the group.","1804":"Highlights\u2022Weak relation between experimental and real life behavior\u2022Unclear relation of time preferences and sustainable behavior\u2022Unclear relation of cooperation in experiments and real life sustainable behaviorAbstractThis paper contributes to the experimental analysis of sustainable behavior in artisanal fisheries and the external validity of economic experiments. We run a standard one-shot public goods experiment and two time preferences experiments with fishermen from Tasajera. It is a small fishing community located in the Caribbean coast of Colombia, which depends mainly on the fishery resources of the Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta for its livelihood.  To investigate the external validity of the experiments, we related the  fishermen's individual decisions in the experiments to some indices  measuring the ecological impact of fishing activities among the same  group of fishermen. We found that fishermen's contributions to the  public good and their levels of impatience are not robustly correlated  to their real fishing behavior. We argue that the link between  fishermen's behavior in the field experiments and real life could be  associated to various factors, such as the specific context in which  fishermen live, and the way in which cooperation in real life is  measured.","1805":"The  response of groups to the experience of coping with resource dilemmas  has been an object of study by scholars in several of the social and  behavioral sciences. Social norms, trust, and the perception of group  identity form cooperative mechanisms critical to group cooperation.  However, the opportunity to communicate has been singled out as the most  important factor influencing group cooperation performance in resource  dilemmas. Until recently, the content of that communication has  undergone little examination. This article examines the relationships  among topical and functional communication content, group performance,  and participant perceptions of cooperative mechanisms in 97 experimental  simulation groups. Detailed discussion of specific strategies was  positively related, and discussion of general strategy, basic  information exchange, and recapitulation of past occurrences in the  simulation were negatively related to both amount of harvest from the  resource pool and participant perceptions of equality norm emergence,  trust, and group identity formation, among others. These perceptions  were positively related with both the total amount and within-group  equality of harvest.","1806":"A  resource dilemma is a circumstance in which an aggregate of people  share a slowly replenishing resource pool out of which each person can  harvest for her or his own use.

Participants contributed most when personal involvement was lowest (i.e., Third Party) and least when personal involvement was high (i.e., Self). Study 2 explored if social motives underlie third-party cooperation by comparing cooperation with social (human) and non-social (computer) group members. Reducing personal involvement in the PGG (i.e., Third Party)  increased cooperation in social contexts compared with non-social  contexts, indicating enhanced collective interest.

This research attempted to adjudicate between these explanations by  experimentally varying conditions of social exchange in an effort to  make participants more or less concerned about other relationships in  the network and more or less attached to fellow group members. Results  indicate potential support for both explanations, although they reveal a  process more complex than that theorized. In particular, participants  receiving gifts from partners led to more holistic orientations, but it  did not appear to do so through stronger affective attachment.

A breakthrough can be achieved by revealing the  microfoundations of sociality, an additional component of the utility  function reflecting the value of contributing to group success derived  from social identity. Building upon our previous behavioral work, we  conduct a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  experiments (N = 10 in the Pilot Study and N = 15 in the  Main Study) to measure whether and how sociality alters the functional  activation of and connectivity between specific systems in the brain.  The overarching hypothesis of this study is that sociality, even in a  minimal form, serves as a natural mechanism of sustainable cooperation  by fostering interaction between brain regions associated with social  cognition and those related to value calculation. We use group-based  manipulations to induce varying levels of sociality and compare behavior  in two social dilemmas: Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma and variations of Ultimatum  Game. We find that activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus, a  region previously associated with cognitive control and modulation of  the valuation system, is correlated with activity in the medial  prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to a greater degree when participants make  economic decisions in a game with an acquaintance, high sociality  condition, compared to a game with a random individual, low sociality  condition. These initial results suggest a specific biological mechanism  through which sociality facilitates cooperation, fairness and provision  of public goods at the cost of individual gain.

Perceptions that the players have  of themselves and of each other do relate to the behaviour of each, as  measured by the relative proportions of one of two possible responses  over the other. However, the context in which this behaviour  takes place, even within the confines of the experimental design, seems  to be an even greater influence on perceptions. This finding would not  have come out if only one kind of game had been played.The method  involved several ways of measuring the subjective elements in strategic  thinking, which seem to be successful in themselves.

That would be the case of a race to the fish when stocks are  becoming depleted or driver behavior on a highly congested road. The  objective of this study is to analyze private inefficient extraction  behavior in experimental games and to associate the type of player and  the type of player group with such inefficient outcomes. To do this, we  carried out economic experimental games with local coastal fishermen in  Colombia, using a setting where the scarcity of the resource allows for  an interior Nash equilibrium and inefficient over-extraction is  possible. The state of the resource, the type of player and the  composition of the group explain, in part, this inefficient behavior.

The  incidence and nature of coalition behavior are examined through a  cognitive approach to group choice, which draws from equity theory,  social dilemmas, and coalition research. The results indicate that  groups lacking an established distribution rule are more likely to form  coalitions than groups operating under an established distribution rule.  Groups in the uncertain condition had significantly lower individual,  as well as group, outcomes. Further, groups lacking a distribution rule  tended to establish a normative rule; both total group distributions and  coalition distributions (when formed) were anchored by available, but  not necessarily relevant, information.","1842":"During  conversation, interlocutors coordinate their behavior on many levels.  Two distinct forms of behavioral coordination have been empirically  linked with affiliation and cooperation during or following face-to-face interaction: behavior matching and interpersonal synchrony.  Only the latter form constitutes behavioral entrainment involving a  coupling between independent oscillators. We present the first study of  the association between spontaneously occurring behavioral coordination  and post-interaction economic game play. Triads of same-sexed strangers  conversed for 10\u00a0min, after which each participant played an  unannounced one-shot prisoner's dilemma (PD) toward each co-participant.  When dyads had higher language style matching scores (LSM: Gonzales,  A.L., Hancock, J.T., &amp; Pennebaker, J.W. (2010). Language style  matching as a predictor of social dynamics in small groups.  Communication Research, 31, 3\u201319), the individuals evaluated each other  more positively, but they were no more likely to cooperate in the PD.  However, when dyads' speech rates (mean syllable duration) converged  more strongly from the beginning to the end of the conversation, they  were more likely to cooperate in the PD, despite no effect on  interpersonal evaluations. Speech rate convergence, a form of rhythmic  entrainment, could benefit interlocutors by mutually reducing cognitive  processing during interaction. We suggest that spontaneous, temporally  based behavioral coordination might facilitate prosocial behavior when the joint cooperative effort is itself perceived as a form of coordination.","1843":"Evolutionary  theory predicts that observable traits should evolve to reliably  indicate unobservable behavioral tendencies in coordination games but  not social dilemmas. We conducted a two-part study to test this idea.  First, we recorded 60-s videos of participants, and then these  participants played a stag  hunt game or a prisoner\u2019s dilemma. Subsequently, raters viewed these  videos, with the sound either off or on, and they guessed player  choices. Raters showed a significant tendency to guess that attractive  players chose stag. In contrast to the prediction, rater accuracy was at  chance regardless of whether the sound of the video was off or on. For  prisoner\u2019s dilemma players, raters showed a significant tendency to  guess that women cooperated at a higher rate than men. Again in contrast  to the prediction, accuracy was significantly above chance in this  case. To calibrate the importance of this accuracy rate, we developed  two models that suggest the accuracy we observed in the prisoner\u2019s  dilemma case is probably not high enough to support the evolution of  cooperation. Altogether, our results show that raters tried to achieve a  meaningful degree of accuracy about players by using the limited  information available in the videos, but they could not do so.","1844":"Learning  in finitely repeated games of cooperation remains poorly understood in  part because their dynamics play out over a timescale exceeding that of  traditional lab experiments. Here, we report results of a virtual lab  experiment in which 94 subjects play up to 400 ten-round games of  Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma over the course of twenty consecutive weekdays.  Consistent with previous work, the typical round of first defection  moves earlier for several days; however, this unravelling process  stabilizes after roughly one week. Analysing individual strategies, we  find that approximately 40% of players behave as resilient cooperators  who avoid unravelling even at significant cost to themselves. Finally,  using a standard learning model we predict that a sufficiently large  minority of resilient cooperators can permanently stabilize unravelling  among a majority of rational players. These results shed hopeful light  on the long-term dynamics of cooperation, and demonstrate the importance  of long-run experiments.","1845":"Highlights\u2022A voluntary contributions mechanism (VCM) is mixed with willingness to pay (WTP).\u2022With the VCM, contributions are invariant across the order of mechanisms.\u2022WTP for milk bottles are sensitive to the order of mechanisms and to the period.\u2022WTP differences between milk bottles are stable.\u2022For each bottle, variations of WTP following a messages about attributes are stable.AbstractBy  combining two different types of experiments in one experimental  session, this paper aims at understanding how different contexts may  influence participants\u2019 choices. This paper focuses on one hybrid  experimental session that mixed one voluntary contributions mechanism  (VCM), influencing the indemnity received by participants, and one  mechanism eliciting willingness to pay (WTP) for milk bottles with  public and private attributes. The VCM shows relatively high levels of  contributions that are mainly influenced by the positive expectations of  participants about the average group contribution, rather than by the  variations in the design of this mechanism and the period of  experiments. The WTP for milk bottles are particularly sensitive to the  order of mechanisms and to the period of experiments. Conversely, the  WTP differences between milk bottles for a given round of information  are invariant across the order of mechanisms and the period of  experiments. For each bottle, the variations of WTP coming from the  messages about private and public attributes are also stable over the  order of mechanisms and the period of experiments. This confers validity  to experiments for measuring WTP for public and private attributes  related to food. In other words, these variations of WTP contribute to  welfare estimates and are useful to evaluate market regulations focusing  on public and\/or private attributes.","1846":"This  study reports and analyzes the results of three trials of a one-shot  collective game\u2014a variety of the assurance game\u2014conducted via the World  Wide Web.

First, results from an agent-based model  are consistent with the logic of our argument and are robust across a  variety of initial conditions. Second, results from a controlled  laboratory experiment with human participants support the key  predictions. Across both studies we demonstrate that tie strength,  operationalized as relationship duration, mediates the impact of tie  value on cooperation.","1868":"Dynamic  networks have been shown to increase cooperation, but prior findings  are compatible with two different mechanisms for the evolution of  cooperation. It may be that dynamic networks promote cooperation even in  networks composed entirely of egoists, who strategically cooperate to  attract and maintain profitable interaction partners. Alternatively,  drawing on recent insights into heterogeneous social preferences, we  expect that dynamic networks will increase cooperation only when nodes  are occupied by persons with more prosocial preferences, who tend to  attract and keep more cooperative partners relative to egoists. Our  experiment used a standard procedure to classify participants a priori  as egoistic or prosocial and then embedded them in homogeneous networks  of all prosocials or all egoists, or in heterogeneous networks (50\/50).  Participants then interacted in repeated prisoner's dilemma games with  alters in both static and dynamic networks. In both heterogeneous and  homogeneous networks, we find dynamic networks only promote cooperation  among prosocials. Resulting from their greater cooperation, prosocials\u2019  relations are more stable, yielding substantially higher fitness  compared to egoists in both heterogeneous and homogeneous dynamic  networks. Our results suggest that a key to the evolution and stability  of cooperation is the ability of those with prosocial preferences to  alter their networks.","1869":"Imagined  contact is a relatively new technique designed to focus the accumulated  knowledge of over 500 studies of intergroup contact into a simple and  versatile prejudice-reduction intervention.

Neuroimaging data has shown that the two guilt feelings trigger  different neural networks, with DG selectively activating the insula, a  brain area involved in the processing of disgust and self-reproach.  Thus, insula activation could reflect the major involvement of  self-reproach in DG rather than in AG. However, only a few studies have  empirically tested whether and how DG and AG differently affect decision  making and none have compared enhanced self-worth. Here we asked three  groups of participants, respectively, induced with either pride, DG or  AG, to participate in a third-party version of the ultimatum game in  which they were asked to decide on behalf of others to accept or reject  economic offers with several degrees of fairness. Results revealed that  only deontological participants had higher median acceptances of  Moderately Unfair offers as compared to proud participants. However  fairness judgments were not different between groups, suggesting that  deontological participants\u2019 moral standards had not decreased.  Crucially, a higher increase in DG was associated with an increase in  the odds of accepting 30:70 offers. The opposite effects that DG and  pride exert on self-worth can account for these results. Specifically,  proud participants felt entitled enough to take action in order to  restore equity, while deontological participants followed the \u201cDo not  play God\u201d principle, which limited their decisional autonomy, not  allowing them to decide on behalf of others.","1887":"  Background Cooperation  is necessary in many types of human joint activity and relations.  Evidence suggests that cooperation has direct and indirect benefits for  the cooperators. Given how beneficial cooperation is overall, it seems  relevant to investigate the various ways of enhancing individuals'  willingness to invest in cooperative endeavors. We studied whether  ascription of a transparent collective goal in a joint action promotes  cooperation in a group.   Methods A  total of 48 participants were assigned in teams of 4 individuals to  either a \u201ctransparent goal-ascription\u201d or an \u201copaque goal-ascription\u201d  condition. After the manipulation, the participants played an anonymous  public goods game with another member of their team. We measured the  willingness of participants to cooperate and their expectations about  the other player's contribution.   Results Between  subjects analyses showed that transparent goal ascription impacts  participants' likelihood to cooperate with each other in the future,  thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions.  Further analysis showed that this could be explained with a change in  expectations about the partner's behavior and by an emotional alignment  of the participants.   Conclusion The  study found that a transparent goal ascription is associated with an  increase of cooperation. We propose several high-level mechanisms that  could explain the observed effect: general affect modulation, trust,  expectation and perception of collective efficacy.

Individuals have private information  about contribution costs. Individuals can each make a discrete  contribution. If the number of contributors is at least equal to the  threshold, a public benefit accrues to all members of the group. We  experimentally implement three different communication structures prior  to the decision move: (a) simultaneous exchange of binary messages, (b)  larger finite numerical message space and (c) unrestricted text chat. We  obtain theoretical bounds on the efficiency gains that are obtainable  under these different communication structures. In an experiment with  three person groups and a threshold of two, we observe significant  efficiency gains only with the richest of these communication  structures, where participants engage in unrestricted text chatting. In  that case, the efficiency bounds implied by mechanism design theory are  achieved.","1890":"Participants  engaged in the Prisoner\u2019s dilemma game with a partner through a  computer terminal. We define two types of partner: a perceived partner  and an actual partner, and manipulated the two factors independently. A  perceived partner means a partner with whom participants imagined  themselves to be interacting; instruction given by an experimenter  controls the image of the perceived partner. An actual partner can  change its behavior. In one scenario participants actually interacted  with a human partner, in another scenario their partner was either a  mostly cooperating computer agent or a mostly defecting computer agent.  Three experiments were performed. The result suggested that the  participants\u2019 selection behavior was largely influenced by the  instruction given about the partner by the experimenter and not  influenced by the partner\u2019s actual behavior. The analysis of the  participants\u2019 impressions of the partner showed that the effect of  instruction about the partner disappeared. Individual likeability for a  partner was very influenced by the partner\u2019s behavior; as the  participants incurred more defect actions from the partner, individual  likeability for the partner decreased. On the other hand, social  likeability for a partner was not so influenced by the partner\u2019s  behavior, but rather related to the participants\u2019 own behavior. The  participants who made more defect actions rated their partner\u2019s social  likeability lower.Highlight\u25ba  Participants engaged in a dilemma game with a computer agent or a  human. \u25ba Instruction about a partner affected the participants\u2019 decision  behavior. \u25ba Partner\u2019s behavior did not affect the participants\u2019  decision behavior. \u25ba Individual likability of a cooperating partner was  higher. \u25ba Social likability was higher when the participants made more  cooperate actions.","1891":"['investigates', 'hostage', 'posting', 'institutionas', 'mechanism', 'co', 'operation', 'two', 'person', 'prisoner', 'sdilemma', 'game', 'theoretic', 'conditions', 'specified', 'necessary', 'boost', 'operative', 'behaviour', 'role', 'transaction', 'costs', 'bonuses', 'productive', 'hostages', 'experiment', 'n', '216', 'shows', 'games', 'characterised', 'nash', 'equilibrium', 'subgame', 'perfect', 'create', 'sufficient', 'encourage', 'actors', 'post', 'maximin', 'criterion', 'met', 'ensure', 'mutual', 'significantly', 'discourage', 'subjects', 'taking', 'advantage', 'institution', 'influence']","1892":"This  paper provides a novel tax behavior explanation for investor home bias.  Specifically, we show that investors are reluctant to hold foreign  equity with a tax levied by a foreign tax collector. Starting point is  the observation that willingness to pay taxes depends on the attributes  of the tax collecting country. This relationship indicates a form of  country-specific tax behavior: taxpayers respond to country attributes  as they indicate cooperative and trustworthy behavior of tax  authorities, the government or other taxpayers. We conduct a laboratory  investment experiment to explore the effect of sentiment towards  different tax collectors, specifically of the view on home country  taxation relative to foreign country taxation.

The PD game has been used to model many naturally  occurring interactive situations, at the personal, organizational, and  social levels, in which there exists a tension between individual  material gain and the common good. At least 2 factors may influence the  emergence of cooperative behavior in this well-known collective action  problem: the incentive structure of the game itself, and the intrinsic  social preferences of each of the players. We present a framework that  integrates these 2 factors in an effort to account for patterns of high  or low cooperation from repeated choice interactions. In an experiment  using a collection of different PD games, and a measure of individual  social preferences, we identify regions of PD games in which (a)  cooperation is independent of social preferences; (b) nice people can be  exploited; and (c) being nice is consistently rewarded.

However, the psychological mechanisms of why a game\u2019s payoffs  affect cooperation rates are not clearly explicated with this approach.  We show how simple models of decision making can predict the emergence  of trust based cooperation as the expected utility maximizing strategy  when individual social preferences and positive expectations (beliefs)  are simultaneously taken into account. Moreover, we show how these  predictions relate to a particular game\u2019s index of cooperation.

Experimental studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the use  of both rewards and punishments can indeed effectively increase  cooperation. However, research has only recently begun to identify the  determinants of the willingness to sanction. We investigate the use of  costly sanctions to promote cooperation in the context of social  dilemmas. We argue and demonstrate that people\u2019s willingness to costly  reward and punish is not only determined by the type of sanction (reward  versus punishment) but is also moderated by the type of social dilemma  people face (public good dilemma versus common resource dilemma). In two  experiments, we demonstrate that people reward more and to a greater  extent than they punish, especially in a public good dilemma compared to  a common resource dilemma.","1898":"This  experiment systematically compared the effects of simultaneous  responding and sequential responding by subjects, using a 2 x 4 x 2  factorial design.

It was found that  subjects sent more threats to a compliant than a defiant target. When  the target was Honest-Compliant, the converted the subjects into mutual  cooperators; but when he was Dishonest-Compliant, subjects exploited  him.

The goal of this experiment was to investigate how players\u2019  ability to fine one another affected the players\u2019 patterns of  cooperation, and whether fining itself was affected by the addition of a  shared group consequence.

The present experiments  examine this conflict in a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma game. Versus  tit for tat, cooperation corresponds to self\u2010control; defection, always  immediately reinforced, corresponds to impulsiveness. Three experiments  examined sensitivity of behavior to the global reinforcement contingency  imposed by tit for tat. Undergraduates played a five\u2010player prisoner's  dilemma game against four dummy players programmed to play tit for tat  or randomly. With tit for tat, a player's cooperation (or defection)  increased dummy players' cooperation (or defection) on subsequent  trials\u2014reinforcing cooperation and punishing defection in the long run.  Participants cooperated at a higher rate when the dummy players played  tit for tat than when the dummy players played randomly. These results  are consistent with findings in corresponding studies of self\u2010control.  Some participants, caught in a trap of mutual defection with the  tit\u2010for\u2010tat playing dummy players, came to cooperate when the  tit\u2010for\u2010tat contingency was reset (\u201cforgiving\u201d participants' previous  defections) during a pause in the game. This increase was a result of  the combined effects of a pause and reset; neither pausing nor resetting  independently resulted in an increase in cooperation.

Cooperation between intact pairs  of groups was induced by placing in each group confederates who  successfully convinced their fellow group members of the long-term  advantage of trust and cooperation. On subsequent blocks of trails, the  confederate was replaced by an actual subject, and then each of the  original subjects was replaced so as to simulate generational turnover.  By the time all initial members were replaced, their level of  cooperation had eroded to the level of groups never experiencing mutual  cooperation.

In this paper we focus on a new interactive context, a mixed-motive game called \"Alternative Traveler's Dilemma\" (ATD). In this context, most participants choose strictly dominated strategies. Preliminary studies suggest the reason for such a tendency is that participants have social preferences, usually competitive in nature. The question is whether some cognitive factors should also be included in models that account for the tendency at stake. More specifically, we investigate whether participants neglect payoff maximization, that is, whether they fail to notice that, by pursuing some competitive goal, they are not maximizing their payoffs. We report the results of an experiment that supports this hypothesis.

This  paper studies the impact of such a program in Morocco on social capital  as measured by economic field experiments. We played a public goods game  to measure how much people care about others in the community, an  investment game to proxy interpersonal trust, as well as a dictator game  to measure altruism. Our empirical strategy exploits an administrative  rule stipulating that the program be rolled out only in rural  communities with a poverty rate of 30% and above. Focusing on  communities close to this cut-off and using a regression discontinuity  design, we find that the program increases contributions in public goods  games. Conversely, the program has no impact on altruism and reduces  interpersonal trust. We examine possible mechanisms underlying the  observed impacts by combining the behavioral data with survey  information and administrative records on project spending and  selection. Overall our results suggest that a shift from a centralized  to a more localized decision-making process may enhance people\u2019s sense  of responsibility toward their community, but not all forms of social  capital are positively affected in the process.","1917":"  Abstract  We examined the influence of Individualism and  Collectivism (I\u2013C) on co\u2010operation in workgroups at three levels  (societal, organizational, and personal).

One hundred and twenty young adults (60 male, 60 female),  mostly college students, served as study participants. Participants were  randomly assigned to either a stress condition (Trier Social Stress  Test, a standardized laboratory procedure used to induce psychosocial  stress) or a control condition. Stress induction was confirmed with  self-report questionnaires about perceived stress and anxiety.  Participants then underwent three social decision making tasks to assess  their competitive and cooperative tendencies: an Ultimatum Game, a  Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, and a Prosocial Risk Taking task. We found evidence  for interactive effects of stress and sex in all three tests, and all  interactions were in the same direction. Relative to controls, stressed  males made lower monetary offers to their partners and tended to be less  willing to behave prosocially in a hypothetical risky situation,  whereas stressed females offered higher monetary amounts in the  Ultimatum Game and behaved more cooperatively in the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma.  These results suggest that stress renders males more selfish and  competitive, while stressed females become more other-oriented, more  generous, and more cooperative. These effects are consistent with the  \u2018flight or fight\u2019 pattern for males and the \u2018tend and befriend\u2019 pattern  for females, respectively. The role of risk taking and empathy as  possible psychological mediators of the effects of acute psychosocial  stress on social decision making in men and women needs to be further  investigated, along with sex differences in physiological responsiveness  to stress.","1919":"The  present paper analyzes the extent to which attractiveness-related  variables affect cooperative behavior in women. Cooperativeness is  evaluated through a Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG). We consider several  morphometric variables related to attractiveness: fluctuating asymmetry (FA), waist\u2013hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI) and facial femininity (FF). These variables have been shown to predict human behavior. We also include as a control variable a score for self-perceived attractiveness  (SPA). We test differences in these variables according to behavior in  the PDG. Our results reveal that low-FA women cooperate less frequently  in the PDG. We also find that women with lower WHR are more cooperative.  This result contradicts the expected relation between WHR and behavior  in the PDG. We show that this effect of WHR on cooperation operates  through its influence on the expectation that participants hold on the  cooperative intent of their counterpart. In addition, we show that the  effect of attractive features on cooperation occurs independently of the  participants' perception of their own appeal. Finally, we discuss our  results in the context of the evolution of cooperative behavior and  under the hypothesis that attractiveness is a reliable indicator of  phenotypic quality.","1920":"Highlights\u2022We study experimentally public goods games with punishment under noisy information.\u2022Subjects vote by feet for decentralized, centralized, or no punishment.\u2022The majority of subjects choose decentralized punishment under perfect observability.\u2022Under noise, centralized punishment prevails in the absence of cooperator punishment.AbstractWe  study information conditions under which individuals are willing to  delegate their sanctioning power to a central authority.

Cooperative behavior was assessed by having each S make  50 cooperative or competitive choices in the Prisoner's Dilemma game.  The NCSA group was expected to be more competitive because within the  performing arts, competition is a pervasive characteristic. Each Ss opponent was an accomplice of E who responded according to a predetermined schedule containing 76% cooperative responses. Each S  changed opponents (accomplices) and repeated 50 trials under the same  conditions. The NCSA group was less cooperative than the HS group (p &lt; .01) except on the initial trials, and there was less cooperation on the second game than on the first (p  &lt; .01). The HS group did not decrease across trials in Game 1 as had  been expected. The decrease in cooperation at the beginning of Game 2  was more marked for the NCSA group.

Voluntary participation may foster  cooperation through a mechanism of assortative selection of interaction  partners based on false consensus bias, or through a mechanism whereby  the decision to not participate can be used as a threat against  free-riders. We examine the effectiveness of these mechanisms in a  one-shot public goods experiment. Voluntary participation has a positive  effect on provision only through the threat of non-participation.

Ninety-three Canadian students simulated a commons dilemma  by playing a fishing game for money in groups of three. After each  fishing trial, the students were asked for their perceptions of their  own and of the other players' behavior. In general, it was determined  that they considered both themselves and others to be quite cooperative,  when in fact they were not cooperative.

The results showed that participants who felt high empathy toward a certain individual allocated more resources to the target of empathy, but without reducing the collective good. Then, we adapted the measure of empathy developed by Batson and colleagues (Batson, Ahmad, et al., 1999; Batson, Batson, et al., 1995) to the Spanish context. The results of Experiment 3 supported the existence of a new process: awareness of other individuals present in the social dilemma.

The present study, involving two experiments, examined whether  violations of honesty norms would induce costly third-party punishments.  In both experiments, participants in the third-party role observed a  protocol of the trust game, in which the trustee solicited the trustor  to transfer his\/her endowment by stating that the trustee would return x units from the total resource. Dishonesty was defined such that the trustee in fact returned fewer than x units. Participants were asked about their willingness to incur some cost to reduce the trustee's payoff. In Experiment 1, x  was exactly half of the total resource. Participants were willing to  incur more cost to punish the dishonest trustee than the trustee who  allocated the resource unequally but had not sent the dishonest message.  In Experiment 2, x was more than half of the total resource  and the dishonest trustee allocated the total resource equally.  Therefore, the dishonest trustee was not unfair in Experiment 2.  Approximately half of the participants (16 of 30) punished the dishonest  but fair trustee, while few participants (1 of 30) punished the fair  trustee who had not sent the dishonest message. These experiments  together demonstrated that participants were willing to incur some cost  to punish honesty-norm violators, even when the participants themselves  were not harmed by the norm violation.","1933":"Highlights\u2022We study fundraising mechanisms in a door-to-door fundraising field experiment.\u2022The all-pay auction (APA) is the superior mechanism in theory and in the lab.\u2022In contrast, we find VCMs and a lottery to perform at least as well in the field.\u2022This results from lower participation in APA than in the other mechanisms.\u2022Competition in APA seems to crowd out intrinsic motivations to contribute.AbstractIn  a door-to-door fundraising field experiment, we study the impact of  fundraising mechanisms on charitable giving. We approached about 4500  households, each participating in an all-pay auction, a lottery, a  non-anonymous voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM), or an anonymous  VCM. In contrast to the VCMs, households in the all-pay auction and the  lottery competed for a prize. Although the all-pay auction is the  superior fundraising mechanism both in theory and in the laboratory, it  did not raise the highest revenue per household in the field and even  raised significantly less than the anonymous VCM. Our experiment reveals  that this can be attributed to substantially lower participation in the  all-pay auction than in the other mechanisms while the average donation  for those who contribute is only slightly (and statistically  insignificantly) higher. We explore various explanations for this lower  participation and favor one that argues that competition in the all-pay  mechanism crowds out intrinsic motivations to contribute.","1934":"While  the cooperate vs. defect choice in the prisoner's dilemma is not an  appropriate paradigm for the study of trust and trusting behavior, the  play vs. not play choiceis.

Yet neither male nor female judges use gender to predict  cooperation from particular individuals (trust) or as a criterion for  choosing to play (trusting behavior) when they have the option of not  playing particular prisoner's dilemma games. Further, in our  experimental context, female and male did not differ in their  cooperation rates. We speculate (a) that subjects' generalized  expectations are a response to gender-based role differences outside the  laboratory, (b) that subjects' failure to make individual-by-individual  discriminations by gender is a response to the fact that the  experimental context made such natural-world roles irrelevant, and (c)  that our findings about the irrelevance of genderper se in trusting relationships will be true for other social categoriesper se.","1935":"Five  treatment conditions were compared in a typical Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma  experimental situation.

In a  further extension of the allocator game, a superior (called principal)  is introduced who is interested in high production and who can exchange  the allocator. Team production and remuneration are modeled as a linear  public good game with a finite number of periods. The main results are  that (a) the appointment of a random allocator improves production so  that average incomes of all workers, including the allocator, are higher  when compared with voluntary contributions, (b) the introduction of a  principal further improves production as well as satisfaction and  fairness ratings.

This contradicts studies stressing self-serving biases. Self-serving  biases are often identified by asking people what fairness standards  apply in situations with alternative income distributions.  Nevertheless, when the response to a question is connected with a  distributional decision, only the reply, but not necessarily  the fairness standard, is biased. Social preference models envisage  decisions as a compromise between self-interest and social concerns  (norms). A model-based estimation of social concerns, as provided by  this paper, is capable of identifying different sorts of self-serving  biases. Higher income triggers higher fairness scores, but there are no  indications that a relatively higher income compared to the peers is generally perceived as fairer than a relatively lower income.","1938":"Punishment  of non-cooperators\u2014free riders\u2014can lead to high cooperation in public  goods games (PGG). However, second-order free riders, who do not pay  punishment costs, reduce the effectiveness of punishment. Here we  introduce a \u201cleader support system,\u201d in which one group leader can  freely punish group followers using capital pooled through the support  of group followers. In our experiment, participants engage in three  stages repeatedly: a PGG stage in which followers decide to cooperate  for their group; a support stage in which followers decide whether to  support the leader; and a punishment stage in which the leader can  punish any follower. We compare a support-present condition with a  no-support condition, in which there is an external source for the  leader\u2019s punishment. The results show that punishment occurs more  frequently in the support-present condition than the no-support  condition. Within the former, both higher cooperation and higher support  for a leader are achieved under linkage-type leaders\u2014who punish both  non-cooperators and non-supporters. In addition, linkage-type leaders  themselves earn higher profits than other leader types because they  withdraw more support. This means that leaders who effectively punish  followers could increase their own benefits and the second-order free  rider problem would be solved.","1939":"Cooperation  is fundamental to human societies, and one of the important paths for  its emergence and maintenance is reciprocity. In prisoner\u2019s dilemma (PD)  experiments, reciprocal strategies are often effective at attaining and  maintaining high cooperation. In many public goods (PG) games or n-person  PD experiments, however, reciprocal strategies are not successful at  engendering cooperation. In the present paper, we attribute this  difficulty to a coordination problem against free riding among  reciprocators: Because it is difficult for the reciprocators to  coordinate their behaviors against free riders, this may lead to  inequality among players, which will demotivate them from cooperating in  future rounds. We propose a new mechanism, institutionalized  reciprocity (IR), which refers to embedding the reciprocal strategy as  an institution (i.e., institutionalizing the reciprocal strategy). We  experimentally demonstrate that IR can prevent groups of reciprocators  from falling into coordination failure and achieve high cooperation in  PG games. In conclusion, we argue that a natural extension of the  present study will be to investigate the possibility of IR to serve as a  collective punishment system. ","1940":"Second-order  free riders, who do not owe punishment cost to first-order free riders  in public goods games, lead to low cooperation. Previous studies suggest  that for stable cooperation, it is critical to have a pool punishment  system with second-order punishment, which gathers resources from group  members and punishes second-order free riders as well as first-order  free riders. In this study, we focus on the priority of punishment. We  hypothesize that the pool punishment system that prioritizes  second-order punishment is more likely to achieve cooperation than the  system that prioritizes first-order punishment, because the former is  more likely to obtain sufficient punishment resources. In the  experiments, we compare four pool punishment systems: 1To2 (first-order  punishment to second-order punishment), 2To1 (second-order punishment to  first-order punishment), 1ONLY (first-order punishment only), and 2ONLY  (second-order punishment only). We find that the 2To1 and 2ONLY systems  can receive more support than the 1To2 and 1ONLY systems and only the  2To1 system can achieve high cooperation. However, the effect of  priority of second-order punishment is observed only when the punishment  ratio (PR) is low (Experiment 1), not high (Experiment 2), in which the  punishment resource is relatively abundant.","1941":"Strong  negative reciprocity, that is, sanctions imposed on norm violators at  the punisher\u2019s own expense, has powerful cooperation-enhancing effects  in both real-life and experimental game situations. However, it is  plausible that punishment may obtain alternative roles depending on  social context and the personality characteristics of participants. We  examined the occurrence of punishing behavior among 80 subjects in a  strongly competitive Public Goods game setting. Despite the punishment  condition, the amount of the contributions decreased steadily during the  game. The amount of contributions had no significant effect on received  and imposed punishments. The results indicate that certain social  contexts (in this case, intensive competition) exert modifying effects  on the role that punishment takes on. Subjects punished each other in  order to achieve a higher rank and a financially better outcome.  Punishment primarily functioned as a means of rivalry, instead of as a  way of second-order cooperation, as strong reciprocity suggests. These  results indicate the need for the possible modification of the social  conditions of punishment mechanisms described by the strong reciprocity  theory as an evolutionary explanation of human cooperation.

Skewness is a measure of the  asymmetry of the distribution of endowments around the mean. We argue  that skewness reflects the social distance between \u2018elite\u2019 players with  high initial endowments and other players with lower endowments, better  than variance and concentration measures like the Gini-coefficient. We  hypothesize that elite players become more selfish with increasing  skewness and therefore contribute less to a public good in the framework  of a one-shot non-linear public good game. The results of an  experimental test, in which we systematically vary the distribution of  endowments between treatments, confirm that the model is able to  correctly explain the observed pattern of contribution behavior. We find  that cooperation and efficiency are lowest with right-skewed  distribution of endowments.

The linked punishment-reward  set up is of theoretical interest and could represent simultaneous  shifts of social disapproval and approval. Conjectures that punishment  will be better targeted, and that it will be more substantial for given  deviation from others\u2019 contributions, receive support.

This paper  provides experimental evidence suggesting that people in peer-approval  competitions value social approval more when it leads to unique and  durable rewards. Our evidence suggests that such rewards act as a  signaling mechanism, thereby contributing to the value of approval. We  show that this signaling mechanism generates cooperation at least as  effectively as cash rewards. Our findings point to the potential value  of developing new mechanisms that rely on small non-monetary rewards to  promote generosity in groups.","1946":"Dozens  of studies show that bystanders are less likely to help victims as  bystander number increases.

Results indicate that men invested into partners  significantly more than women did (34% \u2642 vs. 24% \u2640) while women, in  turn, were more likely to defect (65% \u2640 vs. 50% \u2642). In this region,  women have customarily held less economic power and they are used to  obtain a payoff typically lower than men. We suggest that the women\u2019s  willingness to invest in cooperation has decreased throughout  evolutionary time, providing us with an illustration of a  culturally-driven shift towards a disparity in gender cooperation  interests.

In each pair,  one person (subject) took the tablets and the other (flatmate) received  no treatment. On the last day of each treatment period, the subjects  socially interacted with a confederate behaving as a responsive person  in a stranger-dyadic social interaction paradigm. After the interaction,  subjects played the Mixed-motive game, which measures cooperative  behaviour and communication, with the confederate. The flatmates  evaluated the social behaviour of the subjects before and at the end of  the treatment periods.Results. On citalopram, the subjects  were rated as significantly less submissive by their flatmates and they  showed a dominant pattern of eye contact in the stranger-dyadic social  interaction paradigm.

We compared  cooperative decisions and electroencephalograph data between genders  from who participated in repeated rounds of the public goods game (PGG)  and investigated within groups changes that occurred after watching a TV  program known as \u201cinvestigative reporting\u201d that denounces unfair  advantages taken by free-riders against the public. Women tended to be  more cooperative than men during early rounds of PGG, mostly because  they react differently to the defection of others; women also had  greater \u03b2 and \u03b3 band activity in regions estimated to be associated with  social cognition. These gender differences disappeared after  participants watched the TV programs: women were more likely to choose  free-riding in response to the defection of others that elicits  significant increases in \u03b3 band activities that were estimated to be  right insula. Greater activity in social cognition leads women to make  decisions considering the motives of others, while men tend to make a  decision by complying with the social norm.

However, if the state of the resource is not known,  the ability to know what others are doing is critical for cooperation.

The effect is, however, insignificant, which could be due to the higher  variance in presence of rewards and sanctions. Furthermore, it is  evidenced that rewards have some negative effect on the future  contribution for both the imposer and the imposed when the partner  matching is applied, but both rewards and sanctions have mainly positive  effects under the stranger matching.

The implications of the study are that researchers and  practitioners should consider how to develop sportspersonship and  emotional intelligence to boost cooperation in various domains.","1960":"We  used a mobile eye-tracking system (in the form of glasses) to study the  characteristics of visual perception in decision making in the  Prisoner's Dilemma game. In each experiment, one of the 12 participants  was equipped with eye-tracking glasses. The experiment was conducted in  three stages: an anonymous Individual Game stage against a randomly  chosen partner (one of the 12 other participants of the experiment); a  Socialization stage, in which the participants were divided into two  groups; and a Group Game stage, in which the participants played with  partners in the groups. After each round, the respondent received  information about his or her personal score in the last round and the  overall winner of the game at the moment. The study proves that  eye-tracking systems can be used for studying the process of decision  making and forecasting. The total viewing time and the time of fixation  on areas corresponding to noncooperative decisions is related to the  participants\u2019 overall level of cooperation. The increase in the total  viewing time and the time of fixation on the areas of noncooperative  choice is due to a preference for noncooperative decisions and a  decrease in the overall level of cooperation. The number of fixations on  the group attributes is associated with group identity, but does not  necessarily lead to cooperative behavior.

In the present study, basal cortisol was  assessed prior to a public goods game with the option to punish other  group members.

Reward and  punishment mechanisms have been demonstrated to affect contributions in  the PGGs. This paper examines whether dispositional sensitivities to  rewards and punishments (BIS and BAS) explain some behavioural  heterogeneity in PGGs. Seventy-two participants took part in a  sequential PGG, in which, prior to making a decision about contributing,  participants received information about how much their co-players had  donated, which was manipulated either as high or low. They also  completed the Carver and White BIS\/BAS scales. Participants contributed  more when other members of their group contributed a high proportion of  the initial endowment and less when others gave a low amount. When  participants knew that their group members had contributed a high  amount, BAS Reward Responsiveness was significantly negatively  correlated with the contribution levels, while BIS-anxiety was  positively related to a lower proportion of zero contributions. The  findings are interpreted in relation to strategic responding in the  PGGs.

The two experimental  conditions, identical but for the added control over illicit  communication, used an extended form of the prisoners dilemma game. The  game was modified to permit both gradations in the level of cooperation  and a specific channel for expressing indications of intention to an  adversary. While the intended signal did not affect cooperation rates,  the condition which made an illicit signal possible did reduce  cooperation. Detailed analysis indicates that a significant degree of  illicit signaling, conveyed here through the sound of turning tokens,  did occur. Also significant was the tendency for the illicit signal to  be used deceptively, i.e., to be used under conditions likely to suggest  cooperating, disarming in the current study, rather than defecting  (arming) to the other player. The discussion indicates the degree to  which opportunities for interparty communication will be grasped,  sometimes to the extent of biasing results, in group studies which try  to constrict intersubject communication. It shows also that opportunity  for deceptive communication within the understood rules does not  aggravate conflict as much as similar illicit messages about clandestine  happenings. The findings are relevant to an appreciation of factors  affecting noise in the channels of communication in two\u2010party conflicts.  Elements of a taxonomy applicable both to the moves of individual  subjects and to nation states in conflict situations suggest the  relevance of understanding of feedback occurring through unanticipated  communication channels.

Rarely are both dilemmas examined simultaneously, a  potential oversight considering research on decision-making implicates  give-and-take differences. In this paper, we propose that an important  part of cooperating in different social dilemmas involves emotionally  guided goals, termed emotivations.

Sequential moves result in a larger provision of the public good,  because the follower mimics the action of the leader, and in accounting  for this response, the leader chooses to contribute when it is efficient  to do so. An experimental investigation of the game shows that the  donors predominantly choose to contribute sequentially, and that the  resulting contributions are larger than those of the simultaneous-move  game. Although the gain from sequential moves is smaller when the  sequence is set exogenously, our results suggest that the involved  parties would benefit from having sequential moves imposed upon them.

However, cooperation can be facilitated by introducing  reputational incentives. Through indirect reciprocity, people who  cooperate in a social dilemma are more likely to receive cooperative  acts from others. Another mechanism that enhances group cooperation is  reputation-based partner choice, or competitive altruism.  According to this framework, cooperators benefit via increased access  to cooperative partners. Our study compared the effectiveness of  indirect reciprocity and competitive altruism in re-establishing  cooperation after the typical decline found during repeated public goods  games. Twenty groups of four participants first played a series of  public goods games, which confirmed the expected decline. Subsequently,  public goods games were alternated with either indirect reciprocity  games (in which participants had an opportunity to give to another  individual from whom they would never receive a direct return) or  competitive altruism games (in which they could choose partners for  directly reciprocal interactions). We found that public goods game  contributions increased when interspersed with competitive altruism  games; they were also higher than in public goods games interspersed  with indirect reciprocity games. Investing in reputation by increasing  contributions to public goods was a profitable strategy in that it  increased returns in subsequent competitive altruism and indirect  reciprocity games. There was also some evidence that these returns were  greater under competitive altruism than indirect reciprocity. Our  findings indicate that strategic reputation building through competitive  altruism provides an effective alternative to indirect reciprocity as a  means for restoring cooperation in social dilemmas.","1989":"For  a population of interacting self-interested agents, we study how the  average cooperation level is affected by some individuals' feelings of  being betrayed and guilt. We quantify these feelings as adjusted payoffs  in asymmetric games, where for different emotions, the payoff matrix  takes the structure of that of either a prisoner's dilemma or a  snowdrift game. Then we analyze the evolution of cooperation in a  well-mixed population of agents, each of whom is associated with such a  payoff matrix. At each time-step, an agent is randomly chosen from the  population to update her strategy based on the myopic best-response  update rule. According to the simulations, decreasing the feeling of  being betrayed in a portion of agents does not necessarily increase the  level of cooperation in the population. However, this resistance of the  population against low-betrayal-level agents is effective only up to  some extend that is explicitly determined by the payoff matrices and the  number of agents associated with these matrices. Two other models are  also considered where the betrayal factor of an agent fluctuates as a  function of the number of cooperators and defectors that she encounters.  Unstable behaviors are observed for the level of cooperation in these  cases; however, we show that one can tune the parameters in the function  to make the whole population become cooperative or defective.

In addition, we find no evidence of short-term hunger having an  impact on charitable giving or decisions in public good game.","1993":"  Abstract  A multistage Prisoner's Dilemma (MPD) game is presented as a  paradigm for a special class of interdependent mixed\u2010motive conflicts.  The MPD game is composed of several PD subgames (conflicts) which are  interconnected in the sense that each joint decision determines, in  addition to the payoff for each player, the next subgame (conflict) to  be played. Several experiments are reported, using both male and female  players. The results show that players are aware of the delicate  strategic considerations involved in the game and are affected by the  strategy employed by the other player. When die game is perceived as an  individual decision task, the percentage of cooperative behavior  increases. A normative model for the MPD game is presented. Its failure to account for the observed results is discussed briefly.   ","1994":" We  address two related issues. First, we analyze the effects of risk  preferences on cooperation in social dilemmas. Second, we compare social  dilemmas in which outcomes represent gains with dilemmas where outcomes  represent losses. We show that predictions on gain\u2010loss asymmetries  with respect to conditions for cooperation crucially depend on  assumptions concerning risk preferences. Under the assumption of risk  aversion for gains as well as losses together with an assumption of  decreasing absolute risk aversion, conditions for cooperation are less  restrictive if outcomes represent losses than if outcomes represent  gains. Conversely \u2010 and counterintuitively \u2010 under the assumption of  S\u2010shaped utility, conditions for cooperation are more restrictive  if outcomes represent losses than if outcomes represent gains. We  provide an experimental test of such predictions. Only a minority of  subjects behaves consistent with the assumption of S\u2010shaped utility.  Furthermore, we find no empirical evidence for a general difference  between cooperation in social dilemmas in which outcomes represent gains  and dilemmas where outcomes represent losses. We do find evidence that  risk preferences affect cooperation rates.

Previous research suggests that the costly punishment of group members  who do not contribute to public goods plays an important role in the  resolution of collective action dilemmas. If large-scale cooperation  sustained by the punishment of defectors has evolved through the  mechanism of cultural group selection, two implications regarding costly  punishment follow: (1) that people are more willing to punish defecting  group members in a situation of intergroup competition than in a  single-group social dilemma game and (2) that levels of \u201cperverse\u201d  punishment of cooperators are not affected by intergroup competition. We  find confirmation for these hypotheses. However, we find that the  effect of intergroup competition on the punishment of defectors is fully  explained by the stronger conditionality of punishment on expected  punishment levels in the competition condition.","1997":"In  hypothetical scenarios involving two groups (nations or groups of  workers), subjects voted on three proposals: one helped group A (their  group), one helped B, and one helped both groups, more than the average  of the first two but less than their maximum.

This result is  \u201cparochial\u201d because it helps the voter\u2019s own group even though it hurts  the other group more. When voters could approve two proposals, they  tended to approve the third proposal as well, and it was more likely to  win. Approval voting can thus reduce the effect of parochialism, a bias  toward one\u2019s own group, on election outcomes. In a second experiment,  the authors replicated this effect using real-money payoffs.","1998":"Contributions  to public goods can be motivated by intrinsic factors such as warm glow  altruism and fairness, as well as extrinsic incentives such as  sanctions and payments. However, psychological studies suggest that  formal extrinsic incentives may crowd out intrinsic motivations.

This has  implications for the design of public policy where ranges of motivations  are present.","1999":"Social  norms can help to foster cooperation and to overcome the free-rider  problem in the private provision of public goods. This paper focuses on  the endogenous establishment of an average-oriented norm which sanctions  deviations from average public good contributions. In a laboratory  experiment, we analyse whether subjects are willing to implement a  punishment and reward scheme at their own expense by applying the theory  of non-governmental norm enforcement put forward by  Buchholz\u00a0et\u00a0al. (J Public Econ Theory 16(6):899\u2013916, 2014).  Based on their theory, which omits a central authority but introduces  an endogenously determined enforcement mechanism, we implement a  two-stage public good game. In the first stage, subjects determine the  strength of the sanctioning mechanism on their own. In the second stage,  they decide on their personal contributions to the public good based on  the established mechanism. In line with comparable pool punishment  experiments, we find that subjects are apparently willing to contribute  funds in order to establish a norm enforcement mechanism. Groups  over-invest in the mechanism, but this over-investment decreases over  time. These investments seem to be driven by the subjects\u2019 previous  individual contributions and partly by a number of strategic  considerations, i.e. the previous average contribution made to the  public good lowers the investment in the sanctioning mechanism. In the  second stage of our experiment, higher norm enforcement parameters tend  to lead to higher public good contributions. The earnings with the  mechanism are on average higher than without.","2000":"Highlights\u2022The paper uses a novel public goods game to study cooperation in heterogeneous groups.\u2022Agents differ from each other in their dominant and socially-optimal strategies.\u2022Sanctions are ineffective, as uncooperative behavior is not easily recognized.\u2022Communication is particularly effective when agents can reveal their type.\u2022Most players report truthfully and contributions are significantly higher.AbstractThe  public goods game has been studied extensively in the lab as the  quintessential model of a social dilemma. Several mechanisms have been  demonstrated to promote group cooperation in linear voluntary  contribution experiments \u2013 such as communication, costly punishment, and  centralized bonuses and fines. However, lab experiments have largely  neglected a central obstacle to efficient public good provision:  Individuals typically have different, private demands for consumption,  hindering the ability of either a central authority or the group members  themselves to calculate and enforce the optimal behavior. I adapt the  standard public goods game to incorporate heterogeneous incentives and  provide an assessment of each mechanism in this richer environment. I  find that baseline cooperation is similar to that in the standard linear  game. Sanctions are weak and generally ineffective. Communication,  however, does promote cooperation, especially when subjects are  given the opportunity to reveal their demand or demand is observable.  Finally, a centralized fine\/bonus scheme is most effective at increasing  contributions, but low demanders must pay a fine in equilibrium.","2001":"Cross-culturally,  participants in public goods games reward participants and punish  defectors to a degree beyond that warranted by rational,  profit-maximizing considerations. Costly punishment, where individuals  impose costs on defectors at a cost to themselves, is thought to promote  the maintenance of cooperation. However, despite substantial variation  in the extent to which people punish, little is known about why some  individuals, and not others, choose to pay these costs. Here, we test  whether personality traits might contribute to variation in helping and  punishment behavior. We first replicate a previous study using public  goods scenarios to investigate effects of sex, relatedness and  likelihood of future interaction on willingness to help a group member  or to punish a transgressor. As in the previous study, we find that  individuals are more willing to help related than unrelated needy others  and that women are more likely to express desire to help than men.  Desire to help was higher if the probability of future interaction is  high, at least among women. In contrast, among these variables, only  participant sex predicted some measures of punitive sentiment. Extending  the replication, we found that punitive sentiment, but not willingness  to help, was predicted by personality traits. Most notably, participants  scoring lower on Agreeableness expressed more anger towards and greater  desire to punish a transgressor, and were more willing to engage in  costly punishment, at least in our scenario. Our results suggest that  some personality traits may contribute to underpinning individual  variation in social enforcement of cooperation.","2002":"Data  from self-report and observational studies make it clear that  problematic social anxiety confers interpersonal constraint that may  contribute to the interpersonal dysfunction reported by individuals with  social anxiety disorder. Direct observation of interpersonal behavior  in established relationships is rare and difficult to obtain for  practical reasons. We tested a flexible iterated prisoner's dilemma  computer task to examine whether it might capture interpersonal  constraint related to social anxiety. Our first study suggested that, at  least for men, the task directly captures social anxiety's constraint  on responses to friendly giving. Our second study more strongly  supported the assertion that the task directly assesses interpersonal  constraint. The data support a model in which social anxiety directly  confers trait-like tendencies toward interpersonal constraint and  indirectly constrains behavior in specific interactions. These studies  provide further evidence that constrained responses to positive social  behaviors are characteristic of people with problematic social anxiety  and may be particularly important to dysfunctions in the close  relationships of these individuals.Research highlights\u25ba  Giving on a prisoner's dilemma correlated with trait-like interpersonal  constraint. \u25ba Giving behavior was also consistent with expectations  based on actual interactions. \u25ba Social anxiety indirectly influenced  giving through interpersonal constraint. \u25ba Constraint of positive  reciprocity may underlie relationship impairment.","2003":"Although  social anxiety disorder appears to confer impairment in friendships,  evidence beyond self-report is minimal. We used the flexible iterated  prisoner's dilemma as a simulated interaction with a friend with 27  individuals with the generalized type of social anxiety disorder and 23  demographically equivalent individuals without the disorder.  Participants with generalized social anxiety disorder were less giving  on the task. Lower giving was also moderately associated with  interpersonal variables (e.g., coldness). A trend was also found for  participants with generalized social anxiety disorder to show lower  assertiveness on the task. The connection between generalized social  anxiety disorder and friendship impairment appears likely to be  partially explained by interpersonal constraint that is perceived by  others as coldness and manifests in a behavioral economics task.

We propose  that the benefits of maintaining a positive reputation are not limited  by group boundaries and so people may cooperate to maintain a good  reputation among outgroup members when they will meet and interact with  members of that group again. According to this unbounded indirect  reciprocity perspective, reputation can promote cooperation with both  ingroup and outgroup members. Alternatively, social identity theory  (SIT) favors social identity versus reputation as an explanation for  cooperation among ingroup members. We test these hypotheses across five  studies (Ns\u00a0=\u00a0619, 607, 613, 360, and 615)  that manipulate reputation, social identification, and partner's group  membership in a cooperative decision making task. Across our studies,  people were more cooperative with both ingroup and outgroup members when  their reputation was at stake (Studies 1\u20135), and reputational concern  mediated the effect of cues of gossip on cooperation in interactions  with ingroup and outgroup members (Studies 1\u20134). Social identification  did not affect cooperation with ingroup members.

We find that in public (vs.  private) conditions, contributions go up even when the public good is  already provided (Experiment 1) or is unattainable (Experiment 2).  Furthermore, these conspicuous donations appear to enhance the status  and prestige of the donor because they signal some hidden quality.

This gives us insight into what happens in long repeated  games and into the types of strategies that subjects construct. We  report results obtained from the indefinitely repeated prisoner\u2019s  dilemma with a continuation probability of \u03b4=.95\u03b4=.95.  We find that during such long repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma games,  cooperation drops from the first period of a supergame to the last  period of a supergame. When analyzing strategies, we find that subjects  rely on strategies similar to those found in the literature on shorter  repeated games\u2014specifically Tit-For-Tat, Grim Trigger, and Always  Defect. However, we also identify features of strategies that depend on  more than just the previous period that are responsible for the drop in  cooperation within supergames, but that may be overlooked when using the  common strategy frequency estimation approach.","2008":"This  research asks whether and how institutional trust\u2014trust in the  reliability, effectiveness, and legitimacy of public  institutions\u2014promotes the provision of public goods.

The models carry competing  hypotheses about the interplay of trust and incentives in recycling  behavior. Using survey data collected in four countries (Sweden,  Denmark, the United States, and the United Kingdom), we find a positive  and significant interaction effect of institutional trust and recycling  costs on self-reported recycling behavior. No such interaction was found  using generalized social trust as a second measure of trust. Our  results support a dual-process perspective and indicate that high levels  of institutional trust can suppress the inhibiting effect of individual  costs on cooperation in a collective action dilemma.","2009":"Highlights\u2022We study cultural differences in strength of social norms for cooperation and coordination.\u2022We study the effect of societal threats on the evolved strength of such social norms in evolutionary models.\u2022We find higher threat leads to stronger norms and more punishment of deviance.\u2022Our results illuminate the evolutionary basis for cultural variation in norm strength.AbstractThe  strengths of social norms vary considerably across cultures, yet little  research has shown whether such differences have an evolutionary basis.  Integrating research in cross-cultural psychology with evolutionary game theory,  we show that groups that face a high degree of threat develop stronger  norms for organizing social interaction, with a higher degree of  norm\u2013adherence and higher punishment for deviant behavior. Conversely,  groups that have little threat can afford to have weaker norms with less  punishment for deviance. Our results apply to two kinds of norms: norms  of cooperation, in which individuals must choose whether to cooperate  (thereby benefitting everyone) or enrich themselves at the expense of  others; and norms of coordination, in which there are several equally  good ways for individuals to coordinate their actions, but individuals  need to agree on which way to coordinate. This is the first work to show  that different degrees of norm strength are evolutionarily adaptive to  societal threat. Evolutionary game theoretic models of cultural  adaptation may prove fruitful for exploring the causes of many other  cultural differences that may be adaptive to particular ecological and  historical contexts.","2010":" The  social dilemma is a special situation of social interdependence in  which individual rationality is at odds with group outcomes.

Eventually evaluative traits were  introduced and found useful in the study of EGs, namely the HEXACO  dimension honesty\/humility (H\/H).

Here, a simple model  is devised that illustrates how genetic relatedness changes the  incentive structure of that paradigmatic game which is conventionally  used to model and experimentally investigate collective action problems:  the linear public goods game. Using recent anthropological data sets on  relatedness in contemporary hunter-gatherer and horticulturalist  societies the parameters of the model are estimated. It turns out that  the kinship patterns observed in these societies substantially reduce  the negative effect of increasing group size on incentives for public  goods provision. It is suggested, therefore, that renewed attention  should be given to inclusive fitness theory in the context of public  goods provision also in sizable groups.","2017":"<jats:p> Recent theoretical and experimental investigations of altruistic behavior in intergroup conflict in humans frequently make use of the assumption that warfare can be modeled as a symmetrical n-person prisoner's dilemma, abstracting away the strategic differences between attack and defense.

Drawing on these studies, it is hypothesized that the success of defenses was much more important for individual and kin survival and that a disposition to act altruistically during intergroup conflict is thus more likely to evolve for the strategic situation of defense. It is then investigated empirically if such asymmetries in the occurrence of altruistic behavior during intergroup conflict can be found.

The concept of social discounting can explain cooperation and defection in two-player prisoner's dilemma (PD) games (Axelrod, 1980).  The contingencies of a PD game are such that in any single game  cooperation is costly to each player herself but beneficial to the other  player. From the viewpoint of each player, the costs of cooperation are  fully realized, but the benefits of cooperation are discounted by the  social distance to the other player. The present experiment measured  cooperation and defection in two PD-game conditions with differing  reward magnitudes. In one (the 1-2-3-4 condition), the cost of  cooperation exceeded its socially discounted benefit, and players were  predicted to defect; in the other (the 1-2-9-10 condition), the  discounted benefit of cooperation exceeded its cost, and players were  predicted to cooperate. Over the course of repeated trials defection  increased with the 1-2-3-4 condition but not with the 1-2-9-10  condition.

Participants in our study played the Repeated  Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma Game (RPDG) and the mini Ultimatum Game (mUG) with  robot and human agents, with the agents using either Tit for Tat (TfT)  or Random strategies. As part of the study we also measured the  perceived personality traits in the agents using the TIPI test after  every round of RPDG and mUG. The results show that the participants  collaborated more with humans than with a robot, however they tended to  be equally reciprocal with both agents. The experiment also showed the  TfT strategy as the most profitable strategy; affecting collaboration,  reciprocation, profit and joint profit in the game. Most of the  participants tended to be fairer with the human agent in mUG.  Furthermore, robots were perceived as less open and agreeable than  humans. Consciousness, extroversion and emotional stability were  perceived roughly the same in humans and robots. TfT strategy became  associated with an extroverted and agreeable personality in the agents.  We could observe that the norm of reciprocity applied in HRI has  potential implications for robot design.","2027":"Highlights\u2022An important aspect of managerial decision-making is studied, namely formal employee representation through works councils.\u2022A laboratory experiment is used to study the fundamental mechanisms of works council advice effects.\u2022Students  assume the role of works council representatives giving advice and of  managers taking a price decision in a Prisoner's Dilemma game.\u2022Receiving advice to choose low leads to a higher tendency to choose a low price.\u2022Prosocial managers tend to choose a high price, even when advised to opt for a low price.SummaryThis  paper experimentally studies the effect of works council advice on  managerial decision-making, aiming to gain more insights into the  fundamental mechanisms that may underlie the impact of works council  advice. We conducted laboratory experiments in which subjects played a  two-player Prisoner's Dilemma price-setting game as either a manager or  works council representative. Half of the managers received an advice to  opt for a low or a high price; the other half received no advice.  Managers receiving advice to choose a low price (play Nash) have a  higher tendency to choose a low price. Subjects with an other-regarding  orientation tend to choose a high price. Furthermore, we found an  interaction effect of advice for other-regarding managers.","2028":"nan","2029":"In  the current research we tested a comprehensive model of spirituality,  religiosity, compassion, and altruism, investigating the independent  effects of spirituality and religiosity on compassion and altruism. We  hypothesized that, even though spirituality and religiosity are closely  related, spirituality and religiosity would have different and unique  associations with compassion and altruism. In Study 1 and 2 we  documented that more spiritual individuals experience and show greater  compassion. The link between religiosity and compassion was no longer  significant after controlling for the impact of spirituality. Compassion  has the capacity to motivate people to transcend selfish motives and  act altruistically toward strangers. Therefore, we reasoned that  spirituality (but not religiosity) would predict altruistic behavior and  that compassion would help explain this link. Indeed, in Studies 3, 4,  and 5 we found that more spiritual individuals behaved more  altruistically in economic choice and decision-making tasks, and that  the tendency of spiritual individuals to feel greater compassion  mediated the spirituality-to-altruism relationship. In contrast, more  religious participants did not consistently feel more compassion nor  behave more altruistically. Moreover, in Studies 3 and 4 we found that  the broader traits of Agreeableness, Openness, and Extraversion did not  help explain why more spiritual individuals behaved more altruistically.  Our findings argue that spirituality\u2014above and beyond religiosity\u2014is  uniquely associated with greater compassion and enhanced altruism toward  strangers.

While groups deciding by majority rule reach roughly the same  level of cooperation as individuals, groups deciding by unanimity rule  contribute significantly lower amounts to the public good.","2032":"<jats:sec id=\"S0033291714002475_sec_a1\"><jats:title>Background<\/jats:title><jats:p>Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and bipolar disorder (BD) have overlapping clinical presentations and symptoms \u2013 sources of persistent clinical confusion.

In contrast, when costly punishment is  allowed for, cooperation becomes strategic as it also aims at avoiding  subsequent punishment. If such a sanctioning mechanism is in place,  justice sensitivity no longer predicts cooperation. The results  regarding the degree of cooperation as reaction to initial  non-cooperation of one\u2019s counterparts highlight the role of  justice-concerning personality traits for the sufficient provision of  public goods, as sanctioning institutions are not always possible,  effective, or suitable.","2034":"Research  has repeatedly shown that people who are habitually sensitive towards  unjust victimizations tend to behave uncooperatively and hostile under  certain circumstances.

Two experimental studies are presented in  which participants were confronted with an unfavorable outcome that was  either due to bad luck or to another person\u2019s mean intentions.

Here we test  experimentally whether costs to the donor and need of the receiver  decide about the amount of help provided by unrelated rats in an  iterated prisoner's dilemma game.ResultsFourteen  unrelated Norway rats were alternately presented to a cooperative or  defective partner for whom they could provide food via a mechanical  apparatus. Direct costs for this task and the need of the receiver were  manipulated in two separate experiments. Rats provided more food to  cooperative partners than to defectors (direct reciprocity). The  propensity to discriminate between helpful and non-helpful social  partners was contingent on costs: An experimentally increased resistance  in one Newton steps to pull food for the social partner reduced the  help provided to defectors more strongly than the help returned to  cooperators. Furthermore, test rats provided more help to hungry  receivers that were light or in poor condition, which might suggest  empathy, whereas this relationship was inverse when experimental  partners were satiated.ConclusionsIn  a prisoner's dilemma situation rats seem to take effect of own costs  and potential benefits to a receiver when deciding about helping a  social partner, which confirms the predictions of reciprocal  cooperation. Thus, factors that had been believed to be largely confined  to human social behaviour apparently influence the behaviour of other  social animals as well, despite widespread scepticism. Therefore our  results shed new light on the biological basis of reciprocity.","2036":"Highlights\u2022A gene-by-environment interaction was investigated in healthy adults (n\u00a0=\u00a0195).\u2022Rs53576 and childhood attachment security (CAS) jointly modulated alexithymia.\u2022Interaction of rs53576 and CAS was sexually dimorphic for attachment-related anxiety.\u2022Interaction modulated structure and function of brain areas related to mentalizing.\u2022GG-homozygotes of rs53576 were partly more susceptible to CAS than A-allele carriers.AbstractIntroductionThe oxytocin system is involved in human social behavior and social cognition  such as attachment, emotion recognition and mentalizing (i.e. the  ability to represent mental states of oneself and others). It is shaped  by social experiences in early life, especially by parent\u2013infant  interactions. The single nucleotid polymorphism rs53576 in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene has been linked to social behavioral phenotypes.MethodIn 195 adult healthy subjects we investigated the interaction of OXTR rs53576 and childhood attachment security (CAS) on the personality traits  \u201cadult attachment style\u201d and \u201calexithymia\u201d (i.e. emotional  self-awareness), on brain structure (voxel-based morphometry) and neural  activation (fMRI) during an interactive mentalizing paradigm  (prisoner's dilemma game; subgroup: n\u00a0=\u00a0163).ResultsWe  found that in GG-homozygotes, but not in A-allele carriers, insecure  childhood attachment is - in adulthood - associated with a) higher  attachment-related anxiety and alexithymia, b) higher brain gray matter volume of left amygdala and lower volumes in right superior parietal lobule  (SPL), left temporal pole (TP), and bilateral frontal regions, and c)  higher mentalizing-related neural activity in bilateral TP and precunei,  and right middle and superior frontal gyri.  Interaction effects of genotype and CAS on brain volume and\/or function  were associated with individual differences in alexithymia and  attachment-related anxiety. Interactive effects were in part sexually  dimorphic.ConclusionThe  interaction of OXTR genotype and CAS modulates adult personality as  well as brain structure and function of areas implicated in salience  processing and mentalizing. Rs53576 GG-homozygotes are partially more  susceptible to childhood attachment experiences than A-allele carriers.","2037":"Using  trust games, we study how promises and messages are used to build new  trust where it did not previously exist and to rebuild damaged trust. In  these games, trustees made non-binding promises of  investment-contingent returns, then investors decided whether to invest,  and finally trustees decided how much to return. After an unexpected  second game was announced, but before it commenced, trustees could send a  one-way message. This design allowed us to observe the endogenous  emergence and natural distribution of trust-relevant behaviors and focus  on naturally occurring remedial strategies used by promise-breakers and  distrusted trustees, their effects on investors, and subsequent  outcomes. In the first game 16.6% of trustees were distrusted and 18.8%  of trusted trustees broke promises. Trustees distrusted in the first  game used long messages and promises closer to equal splits to encourage  trust in the second game. To restore damaged trust, promise-breakers  used apologies and upgraded promises. On average, investments in each  game paid off for investors and trustees, suggesting that effective use  of cheap signals fosters profitable trust-based exchange in these  economies.Highlights\u25ba  Promises and messages are used to build new trust and rebuild damaged  trust. \u25ba Promise-breakers use apologies and upgraded promises to restore  damaged trust. \u25ba Distrusted trustees use long messages and equal-split  promises to encourage trust. \u25ba Effective use of cheap signals fosters  profitable exchange.","2038":"  Abstract  In social dilemmas, verbal communication of one's  intentions is an important factor in increasing cooperation. In addition  to verbal communication of one's intentions, also the communication of  emotions of anger and happiness can influence cooperative behavior. In  the present paper, we argue that facial expressions of emotion moderate  verbal communication in social dilemmas. More specifically, three  experiments showed that if the other person displayed happiness he or  she was perceived as honest, trustworthy, and reliable, and cooperation  was increased when verbal communication was cooperative rather than  self\u2010interested. However, if the other person displayed anger, verbal  communication did not influence people's decision behavior. Results also  showed interactive effects on people's perceptions of trustworthiness,  which partially mediated decision behavior. These findings suggest that  emotion displays have an important function in organizational settings  because they are able to influence social interactions and cooperative  behavior.

In spite of  this, relatively little attention has been paid to the potential downstream consequences  of asking self-reliant individuals to work and pursue goals in a team  setting, where their success depends heavily on cooperation and the  performance of others. This paper explores these downstream  consequences. Across three studies, our results reveal that individuals  prompted with self-reliance lose significant self-regulatory capacity  after cooperating as opposed to competing individually, which leads them  to act dishonestly (Experiments 1 and 3) and quit a task early  (Experiment 2). Together, these findings highlight that cooperation,  despite the performance advantages it offers teams, can also contribute  to unforeseen costs for highly self-reliant individuals.","2040":"  Abstract  This article examines the relationship among conflict  orientation, competitive bargaining, and unethical behavior. We report  results from a negotiation study (N = 111 dyads) involving a  7\u2010action prisoner's dilemma. We coded participants\u2019 conflict frames and  their use of both competitive ethical tactics and deception. Our results  demonstrate that negotiators\u2019 conflict frames influence the use of both  types of behavior. While prior work has conceptualized competitive  ethical tactics as distinct from unethical tactics (e.g., deception),  our results suggest that in practice negotiators who adopt a competitive  orientation use both types of tactics in tandem. We also examine the  influence of deception on the bargaining process and outcomes. We find  that the use of deception significantly distorts targets\u2019 beliefs,  influences targets\u2019 decisions, increases deceivers\u2019 profits, and harms  targets\u2019 profits.

We clarify this dilemma by first classifying public goods dilemma properties that specify individual outcomes as individual properties (e.g., Marginal Per Capita Return) and group outcomes as group properties (e.g., public good multiplier), mathematically showing how only one set of properties can remain constant as the dilemma size increases. Underpinning decision-making regarding individual and group properties, we propose that individuals are motivated by both individual and group preferences based on a theory of collective rationality. We use Van Lange's integrated model of social value orientations to operationalize these preferences as an amalgamation of outcomes for self, outcomes for others, and equality of outcomes. Based on this model, we then predict how the public good's benefit and size, combined with controlling individual versus group properties, produce different levels of cooperation in public goods dilemmas. A two (low vs. high benefit) by three (2-person baseline vs. 5-person holding constant individual properties vs. 5-person holding constant group properties) factorial experiment (group n = 99; participant n = 390) confirms our hypotheses. The results indicate that when holding constant group properties, size decreases cooperation. Yet when holding constant individual properties, size increases cooperation when benefit is low and does not affect cooperation when benefit is high. Using agent-based simulations of individual and group preferences vis-\u00e0-vis the integrative model, we fit a weighted simulation model to the empirical data. This fitted model is sufficient to reproduce the empirical results, but only when both individual (self-interest) and group (other-interest and equality) preference are included. Our research contributes to understanding how people's motivations and behaviors within public goods dilemmas interact with the properties of the dilemma to lead to collective outcomes.","2050":"article   history: this   paper   reports   two   experiments   involving   an   ultimatum   game,   conducted   in   japan.   there   were   tworeceived   9   may   2013 treatments   in   each   experiment,   which   we   call   the   cash   session   and   the   point   session.   the   cash   sessionreceived   in   revised   form involves   introducing   cash   into   the   procedure   of   the   experiments.   in   other   words,   in   a   cash   session,   sub-18   september   2013 jects   made   decisions   while   holding   cash   in   their   hands,   versus   having   points   or   tokens   as   in   most   prioraccepted   24   september   2013 experiments.   we   found   that,   compared   to   the   point   sessions,   proposers   offered   more   and   respondersrejected   less   frequently   in   the   cash   sessions.   this   is   evidence   that   a   cash   effect   exists   in   ultimatum   gamejel   classi\ufb01cation: experiments.c72 \u00a9 2013 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.c91","2051":"nan","2052":"nan","2053":"nan","2054":"nan","2055":"nan","2056":"['cooperative', 'behavior', 'subject', 'intense', 'wide', 'range', 'scientific', 'fields', 'yet', 'evolutionary', 'origins', 'remain', 'largely', 'unexplained', 'leading', 'explanation', 'cooperation', 'mechanism', 'altruistic', 'punishment', 'individuals', 'pay', 'punish', 'others', 'receive', 'material', 'benefit', 'return', 'experiments', 'shown', 'induce', 'outcomes', 'social', 'dilemmas', 'though', 'sometimes', 'cost', 'reduced', 'welfare', 'typically', 'examine', 'effects', 'punishing', 'low', 'contributors', 'without', 'allowing', 'environment', 'respond', 'full', 'ramifications', 'may', 'understood', 'simulations', 'agents', 'playing', 'continuous', 'prisoners', 'dilemma', 'subsequent', 'act', 'affects', 'efficiency', 'payoffs', 'different', 'network', 'configurations', 'better', 'understand', 'relative', 'structure', 'individual', 'strategies', 'show']","2057":"article history: inthestandardprisoners\u2019dilemma(spd)cooperationisef\ufb01cient.intherepeated,modi\ufb01edreceived 3 april 2017 prisoners\u2019dilemma(mpd)turntakingisef\ufb01cient.itmightbeexpectedthatthecooperativereceivedinrevisedform21november2017 preferences exhibited by some agents, which gives rise to cooperation in the \ufb01nitelyaccepted 25 november 2017 repeated spd, also give rise to turn taking in the \ufb01nitely repeated mpd. we consider thisavailable online 26 november 2017 question theoretically and experimentally. we \ufb01nd experimentally that 50% of participantpairsundertaketurn-takinginthe\ufb01nitelyrepeatedmpd.turntakingcontinuestothe\ufb01naljel classi\ufb01cation: roundfor37.5%ofparticipantpairs, indicating thatatleast18%ofparticipantpairs exhibitc91 cooperative preferences. further, the prevalence of turn taking in the mpd is less thanc73 cooperation in the spd, a \ufb01nding that is consistent with theoretical predictions.psycinfo classi\ufb01cation: \u0001 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.3020","2058":"nan","2059":"nan","2060":"                                           the threat of free-riding makes the marshalling of cooperation from group members a fundamental challenge of social life. where classical social science theory saw the enforcement of moral boundaries as a critical way by which group members regulate one another\u2019s self-interest and build cooperation, moral judgments have most often been studied as processes internal to individuals. here we investigate how the interpersonal expression of positive and negative moral judgments encourages cooperation in groups and prosocial behavior between group members. in a laboratory experiment, groups whose members could make moral judgments achieved greater cooperation than groups with no capacity to sanction, levels comparable to those of groups featuring costly material sanctions. in addition, members of moral judgment groups subsequently showed more interpersonal trust, trustworthiness, and generosity than all other groups. these findings extend prior work on peer enforcement, highlighting how the enforcement of moral boundaries offers an efficient solution to cooperation problems and promotes prosocial behavior between group members.

From the traditional view in cross\u2010cultural psychology, which  emphasizes the collectivistic nature of East Asian peoples, it was  expected that the discontinuity effect would be greater in Japan than in  the United States. On the other hand, based on recent empirical  findings suggesting that North Americans are no less group\u2010oriented than  East Asians, it was expected that the discontinuity effect would be no  greater in Japan than in the United States. One hundred and sixty  Japanese university students played a 10\u2010trial repeated prisoner's  dilemma game: 26 sessions of interindividual and 18 sessions of  intergroup. Following exactly the procedure of prior experiments in the  US, individuals and groups were allowed face\u2010to\u2010face communication with  their opponents before making their decisions, and participants in the  intergroup condition were further allowed to converse freely with their  in\u2010group members. Results replicated previous findings in the United  States; groups made more competitive choices than did individuals. In  addition, neither the magnitude of the discontinuity effect, nor the  frequency of competitive choices made by the groups, were larger in  Japan than they were in the majority of prior studies conducted in the  United States. These findings suggest cross\u2010cultural robustness of the  interindividual\u2013intergroup discontinuity effect. Also, interestingly,  they contradict the simple distinction between individualism and  collectivism. Implications for studies of culture and group processes  are discussed.

","2109":"Individuals with Asperger\u2019s Disorder (ASP) have difficulties in social reciprocity and in providing appropriate cooperative behavior. The Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma (PD) is a well-known model in game theory that illustrates the paradoxical disposition of interaction between two individuals with opposing interests, and may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of ASP in early childhood. In this study, we investigated the cognitive characteristics of ASP by using a modified PD game. The subjects were 29 individuals with ASP and 28 age- and IQ-matched controls. In the PD game, each of two players has two cards: card 1 represents cooperation and card 2 betrayal. The score each player obtains is decided according to a 2 x 2 payoff matrix and depends on the combination of their selections. The P-score (\u201cP\u201d for punishment) is defined as the score that is given when they both select betrayal. Comparing the two groups, the mean P-score at the end of the game and the mean total score were significantly higher in the ASP group, while the rate of selection of cooperative choice in both groups did not differ significantly. The classification of the shape of the graph according to fluctuation of the P-score revealed that in the ASP group only 2 cases (6.9%) showed continuous decrease of P-score compared to 8 control cases (28.6%) demonstrating similar results. However, the reasons were thought to be different: ASP subjects presumably selected card 2 because of a preference for the number itself, whereas control subjects preferentially chose this card to enhance their chance of winning the competition. It is often difficult to diagnose ASP in the young especially when they lack the distinctive clinical features of ASD in early childhood. Given the limited number of objective tools to evaluate the cognitive characteristics of ASP subjects, the PD game might be a useful diagnostic support tool for ASP.","2110":"                                       an experiment was conducted to demonstrate that previous research using the pdg has neglected to separate the effects of strategy from the types of outcomes associated with two-person two-choice games, i.e.; whether it be a two-outcome, three-outcome, or standard four-outcome game. the types of outcomes and the contingent strategies of a \u201cdummy\u201d were manipulated. two strategies were used in the standard pdg four-outcome game, four strategies were varied in the three-outcome game, and one strategy was used in a two-outcome game. seventy ss, 10 under each strategy level, were run. a significant difference between the two-outcome game and the three- and four-outcome games on cooperation proportion over 100 iterations of the game was found. no differences were found between strategies within types. it was concluded that experimentation utilizing \u201cdummy\u201d strategy manipulations must not be of such a nature as to confound types of outcomes with the strategy levels. also, a s\u2019s game behavior does not seem to be sensitive to strategy differences of the \u201cother\u201d player when cooperations over all trials is the dependent variable.

Investigations into whether and how sexual selection is involved in the evolution of cooperation represent a new and important research direction. Here, 69 groups of four men or four women recruited from a rural population in Senegal played a sequential public-good game in the presence of out-group observers, either of the same sex or of the opposite sex. At the end of the game, participants could donate part of their gain to the village school in the presence of the same observers. Both contributions to the public good and donations to the school, which reflect different components of cooperativeness, were influenced by the sex of the observers. The results suggest that in this non-Western population, sexual selection acts mainly on men\u2019s cooperative behaviour with non-kin, whereas women\u2019s cooperativeness is mainly influenced by nonsexual social selection.","2120":"                                           why humans cooperate in large groups and with non-kin remains a puzzle for researchers across the natural and social sciences. investigating whether cooperation is sexually selected could contribute to an understanding of the evolution of human cooperation. competition for access to mates could indeed select for cooperation. using controlled laboratory experiments, we analyse whether and how the sex composition of a social environment, testosterone level and relationship status affect contributions to a public good. the results show that variation in sex composition alters the amount of money that single men (but not men in a couple or women) contribute to a public good. notably, in line with the competitive helping hypothesis, awareness of the presence of a woman leads to larger contributions by single men, most likely by triggering their competitiveness to be the most cooperative man in the group. however, we find no link between basal testosterone level and cooperativeness. we argue that men, notably single men, adopt cooperative behaviours as a signalling strategy in the context of mate choice and hence that cooperation is partly sexually selected. our findings highlight the need to consider sexual selection as an additional mechanism for cooperation.

However, in the presence of noise, co-operators will sometimes be mistaken for defectors and punished, and defectors will sometimes be mistaken for co-operators and escape punishment. Both types of mistakes are detrimental for cooperation because cooperation is discouraged and defection is encouraged. By means of a laboratory experiment, we study whether this adverse effect of noise can be mitigated by consensual punishment. The more other group members have to agree on punishing a defector, the less likely will a co-operator be punished by mistake. We compare a punishment institution in which each subject decides individually whether to punish another, with institutions in which punishments are only implemented if subjects reach sufficient consensus that a particular group member should be punished. In conditions without noise, we find that cooperation and subjects\u2019 payoffs are higher if more consensus is required before a punishment is implemented. In conditions with noise, cooperation is lower if more consensus is required. Moreover, with noise, subjects\u2019 payoffs are lower under all punishment institutions than in the control condition without punishment opportunities. Our results narrow down the conditions under which punishment institutions can promote cooperation if such cooperation is noisy.","2141":"nan","2142":"['article', 'natural', 'resource', 'management', 'conceptualized', 'social', 'dilemma', 'conflict', 'short', 'term', 'self', 'interest', 'users', 'long', 'collective', 'user', 'community', 'versus', 'perspective', 'offered', 'explain', 'individuals', 'decision', 'dilemmas', 'model', 'assumes', 'seek', 'maximize', 'personal', 'benefits', 'regardless', 'implications', 'foster', 'sustainable', 'necessary', 'restrict', 'people', 'access', 'controlling', 'centrally', 'centralization', 'creating', 'system', 'individual', 'individualization', 'alternative', 'suggests', 'communities', 'restraint', 'feel', 'attached', 'two', 'perspectives', 'systematically', 'research', 'water', 'conservation']","2143":"['two', 'experimental', 'studies', 'investigate', 'interacting', 'aggressive', 'virtual', 'characters', 'video', 'games', 'affects', 'trust', 'cooperation', 'players', '1', 'demonstrates', 'experiencing', 'aggression', 'victim', 'perspective', 'impair', 'investments', 'subsequent', 'common', 'goods', 'dilemma', 'situation', 'effect', 'mediated', 'reduced', 'expectations', 'cooperativeness', 'interaction', 'partners', '2', 'same', 'replicated', 'different', 'task', 'investigating', 'moderating', 'role', 'justice', 'sensitivity', 'dispositional', 'factor', 'participants', 'transferred', 'less', 'money', 'unknown', 'partner', 'game', 'exposure', 'nonplayer', 'stronger', 'people', 'high', 'both', 'interpreted', 'line', 'mean', 'intentions', 'model', 'add', 'body', 'research', 'violent', 'media', 'effects']","2144":"Game theory and the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game in particular, which captures the paradox of cooperative interactions that lead to benefits but entail costs to the interacting individuals, have constituted a powerful tool in the study of the mechanisms of reciprocity.

Over the years, various theoretical scenarios aimed at solving the evolutionary puzzle of cooperation have been proposed, eventually identifying several cooperation-promoting mechanisms: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection. We report the results of repeated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma experiments with anonymous and onymous pairwise interactions among individuals. We find that onymity significantly increases the frequency of cooperation and the median payoff per round relative to anonymity. Furthermore, we also show that the correlation between players\u2019 ranks and the usage of strategies (cooperation, defection, or punishment) underwent a fundamental shift, whereby more prosocial actions are rewarded with a better ranking under onymity. Our findings prove that reducing anonymity is a valid promoter of cooperation, leading to higher payoffs for cooperators and thus suppressing an incentive\u2014anonymity\u2014that would ultimately favor defection.","2155":"Networks with dependency links are more vulnerable when facing the attacks. Recent research also has demonstrated that the interdependent groups support the spreading of cooperation. We study the prisoner\u2019s dilemma games on spatial networks with dependency links, in which a fraction of individual pairs is selected to depend on each other. The dependency individuals can gain an extra payoff whose value is between the payoff of mutual cooperation and the value of temptation to defect. Thus, this mechanism reflects that the dependency relation is stronger than the relation of ordinary mutual cooperation, but it is not large enough to cause the defection of the dependency pair. We show that the dependence of individuals hinders, promotes and never affects the cooperation on regular ring networks, square lattice, random and scale-free networks, respectively. The results for the square lattice and regular ring networks are demonstrated by the pair approximation.","2156":"['exploratory', 'investigated', 'degree', 'correspondence', 'individual', 'group', 'interests', 'decision', 'adopt', 'sanctioning', 'system', 'manage', 'shared', 'resource', 'social', 'dilemma', 'properties', 'fifty', 'two', 'groups', 'four', 'people', 'accessed', 'free', 'running', 'computer', 'simulated', 'equal', 'unequal', 'access', 'experienced', 'equitable', 'inequitable', 'consistent', 'past', 'research', 'worse', 'outcome', 'greater', 'voting', 'change', 'found', 'level', 'suggested', 'systems', 'same', 'implications', 'members', 'differences', 'predicted', 'suggests', 'investigate', 'frames', 'structural', 'institutional', 'calls', 'investigation', 'dependencies', 'micro', 'macro', 'units']","2157":"                                           strong reciprocity explains prosocial cooperation by the presence of individuals who incur costs to help those who helped them (\u2018strong positive reciprocity\u2019) and to punish those who wronged them (\u2018strong negative reciprocity\u2019). theories of social preferences predict that in contrast to \u2018strong reciprocators\u2019, self-regarding people cooperate and punish only if there are sufficient future benefits. here, we test this prediction in a two-stage design. first, participants are classified according to their disposition towards strong positive reciprocity as either dispositional conditional cooperators (dcc) or dispositional free riders (dfr). participants then play a one-shot public goods game, either with or without punishment. as expected, dfr cooperate only when punishment is possible, whereas dcc cooperate without punishment. surprisingly, dispositions towards strong positive reciprocity are unrelated to strong negative reciprocity: punishment by dcc and dfr is practically identical. the \u2018burden of cooperation\u2019 is thus carried by a larger set of individuals than previously assumed.

The increase (or decrease) in slower decision makers was prominent among consistent prosocials (or proselfs) whose strong preference for prosocial (or proself) goals would make it less likely to experience conflict between prosocial and proself goals. The strong effect of RT on behavior in consistent prosocials (or proselfs) suggests that conflict between prosocial and selfish goals alone is not responsible for slow decisions. Specifically, we found that contemplation of the risk of being exploited by others (social risk aversion) was partly responsible for making consistent prosocials (but not consistent proselfs) spend longer time in decision making and behave less prosocially. Conflict between means rather than between goals (immediate versus strategic pursuit of self-interest) was suggested to be responsible for the time-related increase in consistent proselfs\u2019 prosocial behavior.

greater good, such as social dilemmas or provision of aid for the needy. One is voluntary sacrifice. The other is to take political action, in order to change the rules so that others will sacrifice in the same way. For a somewhat selfish and rational utilitarian, under specified assumptions, I show that political action is sometimes worthwhile and superior to voluntarism. This situation is more likely to obtain when the actor is moderately selfish (as opposed to being totally selfish or unselfish), and when: cost of political action is low; cost of cooperation is high; the situation involves aid for the needy and the proportion of potential beneficiaries is large; variability in willingness to cooperate is low; some people are already cooperating, but not too many; or the benefit\/cost ratio of contributing increases with the number of contributors."}}
